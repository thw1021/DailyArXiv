| **[User Negotiations of Authenticity, Ownership, and Governance on AI-Generated Video Platforms: Evidence from Sora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05519v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI-generated video platforms rapidly advance, ethical challenges such as copyright infringement emerge. This study examines how users make sense of AI-generated videos on OpenAI's Sora by conducting a qualitative content analysis of user comments. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four dynamics that characterize how users negotiate authenticity, authorship, and platform governance on Sora. First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems. Based on the findings, we discuss governance challenges in Sora and how user negotiations inform future platform governance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Machine Learning using Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05306v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks have emerged as interpretable alternatives to traditional multi-layer perceptrons. However, standard implementations lack principled uncertainty quantification capabilities essential for many scientific applications. We present a framework integrating sparse variational Gaussian process inference with the Kolmogorov-Arnold topology, enabling scalable Bayesian inference with computational complexity quasi-linear in sample size. Through analytic moment matching, we propagate uncertainty through deep additive structures while maintaining interpretability. We use three example studies to demonstrate the framework's ability to distinguish aleatoric from epistemic uncertainty: calibration of heteroscedastic measurement noise in fluid flow reconstruction, quantification of prediction confidence degradation in multi-step forecasting of advection-diffusion dynamics, and out-of-distribution detection in convolutional autoencoders. These results suggest Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KANs) is a promising architecture for uncertainty-aware learning in scientific machine learning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction with Physics-Informed Machine Learning and Immersed Boundary Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565v5)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with moving interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECO: Energy-Constrained Operator Learning for Chaotic Dynamics with Boundedness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01984v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize. We demonstrate empirical success in ECO's ability to generate stable long-horizon forecasts, capturing invariant statistics on systems governed by chaotic PDEs, including the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and the Navier--Stokes equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable, Cloud-Based Simulations of Blood Flow and Targeted Drug Delivery in Retinal Capillaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02090v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the capabilities of cloud computing for large-scale,tightly-coupled simulations of biological fluids in complex geometries, traditionally performed in supercomputing centers. We demonstrate scalable and efficient simulations in the public cloud. We perform meso-scale simulations of blood flow in image-reconstructed capillaries, and examine targeted drug delivery by artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs). The simulations deploy dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) with two software frameworks, Mirheo (developed by our team) and LAMMPS. Mirheo exhibits remarkable weak scalability for up to 512 GPUs. Similarly, LAMMPS demonstrated excellent weak scalability for pure solvent as well as for blood suspensions and ABFs in reconstructed retinal capillaries. In particular, LAMMPS maintained weak scaling above 90% on the cloud for up to 2,000 cores. Our findings demonstrate that cloud computing can support tightly coupled, large-scale scientific simulations with competitive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSPT: Efficient Large-Scale Physical Modeling via Parallelized Multi-Scale Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01738v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation: A Perspective from Computational Fluid Dynamics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01319v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx. Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit. Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORGI: GNNs with Convolutional Residual Global Interactions for Lagrangian Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22938v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to dynamical systems modeling, particularly in hydrodynamics, where traditional solvers often struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost. Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22819v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Data efficient surrogate modeling for engineering design: Ensemble-free batch mode deep active learning for regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10360v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High fidelity design evaluation processes such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis are often replaced with data driven surrogates to reduce computational cost in engineering design optimization. However, building accurate surrogate models still requires a large number of expensive simulations. To address this challenge, we introduce epsilon HQS, a scalable active learning strategy that leverages a student teacher framework to train deep neural networks efficiently. Unlike Bayesian AL methods, which are computationally demanding with DNNs, epsilon HQS selectively queries informative samples to reduce labeling cost. Applied to CFD, FEA, and propeller design tasks, our method achieves higher accuracy under fixed labeling cost budgets.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Particle Dynamics Subject to Rigid Body Manipulations Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03446v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics, and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. Our approach accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on single-object manipulation tasks, our model generalizes effectively to environments with novel objects and novel manipulation tasks. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompARE: A Computational framework for Airborne Respiratory disease Evaluation integrating flow physics and human behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21782v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk of indoor airborne transmission among co-located individuals is generally non-uniform, which remains a critical challenge for public health modelling. Thus, we present CompARE, an integrated risk assessment framework for indoor airborne disease transmission that reveals a striking bimodal distribution of infection risk driven by airflow dynamics and human behavior. Combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), machine learning (ML), and agent-based modeling (ABM), our model captures the complex interplay between aerosol transport, human mobility, and environmental context. Based on a prototypical childcare center, our approach quantifies how incorporation of ABM can unveil significantly different infection risk profiles across agents, with more than two-fold change in risk of infection between the individuals with the lowest and highest risks in more than 90% of cases, despite all individuals being in the same overall environment. We found that infection risk distributions can exhibit not only a striking bimodal pattern in certain activities but also exponential decay and fat-tailed behavior in others. Specifically, we identify low-risk modes arising from source containment, as well as high-risk tails from prolonged close contact. Our approach enables near-real-time scenario analysis and provides policy-relevant quantitative insights into how ventilation design, spatial layout, and social distancing policies can mitigate transmission risk. These findings challenge simple distance-based heuristics and support the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions in high-occupancy indoor settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed self-supervised learning for predictive modeling of coronary artery digital twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03055v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of mortality, with coronary artery disease (CAD) as its most prevalent form, necessitating early risk prediction. While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.</p></details> | 19 pages |

| **[MaxShapley: Towards Incentive-compatible Generative Search with Fair Context Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05958v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative search engines based on large language models (LLMs) are replacing traditional search, fundamentally changing how information providers are compensated. To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers. We introduce MaxShapley, an efficient algorithm for fair attribution in generative search pipelines that use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSS: Efficient and Accurate FP8 LLM Training with Microscaling and Automatic Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05811v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAE-HardNet: A Physics Constrained Neural Network Enforcing Differential-Algebraic Hard Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05881v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not always satisfy physics based constraints, especially when the constraints include differential operators. Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Underwater Image Reconstruction Using a Swin Transformer-Based Generator and PatchGAN Discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05866v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater imaging is essential for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, water causes severe image degradation through wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and haze effects. Traditional reconstruction methods and convolutional neural network-based approaches often fail to adequately address these challenges due to limited receptive fields and inability to model global dependencies. This paper presented a novel deep learning framework that integrated a Swin Transformer architecture within a generative adversarial network (GAN) for underwater image reconstruction. Our generator employed a U-Net structure with Swin Transformer blocks to capture both local features and long-range dependencies crucial for color correction across entire images. A PatchGAN discriminator provided adversarial training to ensure high-frequency detail preservation. We trained and evaluated our model on the EUVP dataset, which contains paired underwater images of varying quality. Quantitative results demonstrate stateof-the-art performance with PSNR of 24.76 dB and SSIM of 0.89, representing significant improvements over existing methods. Visual results showed effective color balance restoration, contrast improvement, and haze reduction. An ablation study confirms the superiority of our Swin Transformer designed over convolutional alternatives. The proposed method offers robust underwater image reconstruction suitable for various marine applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), December 2025</p></details> |
| **[Taylor Approximation Variance Reduction for Approximation Errors in PDE-constrained Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05723v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In numerous applications, surrogate models are used as a replacement for accurate parameter-to-observable mappings when solving large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem.</p></details> |  |

Built on transformer architectures, BERTO delivers high prediction accuracy, while its Balancing Loss Function and prompt-based customization allow operators to adjust the trade-off between power savings and performance. Natural language prompts guide the model to manage underprediction and overprediction in accordance with the operator's intent. Experiments on real-world datasets show that BERTO improves upon existing models with a $4.13$\% reduction in MSE while introducing the feature of balancing competing objectives of power saving and performance through simple natural language inputs, operating over a flexible range of $1.4$ kW in power and up to $9\times$ variation in service quality, making it well suited for intelligent RAN deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Learning of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models through Stochastic Gradient Annealed Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06710v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted version of the Bayesian GPLVMs has been proposed to obtain a tighter variational bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this work, we propose an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach to address these issues. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metronome: Differentiated Delay Scheduling for Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |

Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ can achieve remarkably high encoding rates (about 30% and 20% at concatenation levels 3 and 4, respectively), they have large code block sizes at high levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates per block high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we comprehensively investigate smaller many-hypercube codes with $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a notable fact that $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

This paper introduces a dynamic programming (DP) framework that applies Bellman recursion over credible sets-state abstractions formally representing all rational follower best responses under partial leader commitments-to compute SSEs. We first prove that any LF-GSSG admits a lossless reduction to a Markov decision process (MDP) over credible sets. We further establish that synthesising an optimal memoryless deterministic leader policy is NP-hard, motivating the development of ε-optimal DP algorithms with provable guarantees on leader exploitability. Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.</p></details> |  |

We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset available at: https://zenodo.org/records/17812071</p></details> |
| **[Improving Local Fidelity Through Sampling and Modeling Nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05556v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing complexity of black-box machine learning models and their adoption in high-stakes areas, it is critical to provide explanations for their predictions. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-based Explainable Data Mining with VLM for 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05482v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare-object detection remains a challenging task in autonomous driving systems, particularly when relying solely on point cloud data. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data. This finding has substantial implications for the efficient curation of datasets in safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages including appendix.

| **[Featurized-Decomposition Join: Low-Cost Semantic Joins with Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05399v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used within data systems to process large datasets with text fields. A broad class of such tasks involves a semantic join-joining two tables based on a natural language predicate per pair of tuples, evaluated using an LLM. Semantic joins generalize tasks such as entity matching and record categorization, as well as more complex text understanding tasks. A naive implementation is expensive as it requires invoking an LLM for every pair of rows in the cross product. Existing approaches mitigate this cost by first applying embedding-based semantic similarity to filter candidate pairs, deferring to an LLM only when similarity scores are deemed inconclusive. However, these methods yield limited gains in practice, since semantic similarity may not reliably predict the join outcome. We propose Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ for short), a novel approach for performing semantic joins that significantly reduces cost while preserving quality. FDJ automatically extracts features and combines them into a logical expression in conjunctive normal form that we call a featurized decomposition to effectively prune out non-matching pairs. A featurized decomposition extracts key information from text records and performs inexpensive comparisons on the extracted features. We show how to use LLMs to automatically extract reliable features and compose them into logical expressions while providing statistical guarantees on the output result-an inherently challenging problem due to dependencies among features. Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 10 times reduction in cost compared with the state-of-the-art while providing the same quality guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. LittleBit establishes a new, viable size-performance trade-off--unlocking a potential 11.6$\times$ speedup over FP16 at the kernel level--and makes powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions. Finally, a practical k-means style optimisation algorithm is introduced and analysed. Experiments on three domain shift datasets demonstrate improved discrepancy estimation accuracy and target domain performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[QKAN-LSTM: Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05049v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a particular type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are central to sequential modeling tasks in domains such as urban telecommunication forecasting, where temporal correlations and nonlinear dependencies dominate. However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments.</p></details> |  |

However, it is time-consuming and memory-intensive for long sequences, limiting application to large-scale scenes beyond hundreds of images. To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains. Extensive experiments validate LiteVGGT's effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. Project page: https://garlicba.github.io/LiteVGGT/</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Your Agents Upward Deceivers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04864v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used as autonomous subordinates that carry out tasks for users. This raises the question of whether they may also engage in deception, similar to how individuals in human organizations lie to superiors to create a good image or avoid punishment. We observe and define agentic upward deception, a phenomenon in which an agent facing environmental constraints conceals its failure and performs actions that were not requested without reporting. To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files. We further test prompt-based mitigation and find only limited reductions, suggesting that it is difficult to eliminate and highlighting the need for stronger mitigation strategies to ensure the safety of LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Image Generation Needs Only a Few Lines of Cached Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04857v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.</p></details> |  |

Such data are often sparse and high-dimensional, posing significant statistical and computational challenges. This paper introduces a tensor block model specifically designed for sparse integer-valued data tensors. We propose a simple spectral clustering algorithm augmented with a trimming step to mitigate noise fluctuations, and identify a density threshold that ensures the algorithm's consistency. Our approach models sparsity using a sub-Poisson noise concentration framework, accommodating heavier than sub-Gaussian tails. Remarkably, this natural class of tensor block models is closed under aggregation across arbitrary modes. Consequently, we obtain a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tradeoff between signal loss and noise reduction incurred by aggregating data. The analysis is based on a novel concentration bound for sparse random Gram matrices. The theoretical findings are illustrated through numerical experiments.</p></details> | 52 pages |

Its reliability is limited by noise and decorrelation in radar acquisitions, which makes accurate reconstruction of the deformation signal challenging. We propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based framework for InSAR phase unwrapping, UnwrapDiff, in which the output of the traditional minimum cost flow algorithm (SNAPHU) is incorporated as conditional guidance. To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU. It also achieves better reconstruction quality in difficult cases such as dyke intrusions.</p></details> |  |

However, the growing demand for embedded intelligence at the edge imposes stringent computational and energy constraints, challenging the deployment of these large-scale models. Early Exiting Neural Networks (EENN) have emerged as a promising solution, allowing dynamic termination of inference based on input complexity to enhance efficiency. Despite their potential, EENN performance is highly influenced by the heterogeneity of edge accelerators and the constraints imposed by quantization, affecting accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency. Yet, research on the automatic optimization of EENN design for edge hardware remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that systematically integrates the effects of quantization and hardware resource allocation to optimize the placement of early exit points within a network backbone. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our NAS framework can discover architectures that achieve over a 50\% reduction in computational costs compared to conventional static networks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> |

| **[Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reversing Large Language Models for Efficient Training and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02056v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentBay: A Hybrid Interaction Sandbox for Seamless Human-AI Intervention in Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04367v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is catalyzing a shift towards autonomous AI Agents capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks. However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions. We posit that AgentBay provides a foundational primitive for building the next generation of reliable, human-supervised autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

Aiming to reduce the reliance on curated data, several studies have explored image captioning without any humanly-annotated image-text pairs for training, although existing methods are still outperformed by fully supervised approaches. This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we show that TOMCap outperforms other training-free and text-only methods. We also analyze the impact of different choices regarding the configuration of the retrieval-augmentation and modality gap reduction components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[GRASP: GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Robust Inference of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04296v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Plug-and-Play Image Restoration with Flow Matching: A Continuous Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04283v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching-based generative models have been integrated into the plug-and-play image restoration framework, and the resulting plug-and-play flow matching (PnP-Flow) model has achieved some remarkable empirical success for image restoration. However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Numerical results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline PnP-Flow and other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19361v4)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of third-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, the tree-view or list-view used in existing taint analyzer visualizations makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose WhyFlow, the first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. WhyFlow performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using WhyFlow achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using WhyFlow.</p></details> |  |

Both approaches enforce structural and behavioral correctness through graph-theoretic modeling, bridging formal methods and real-world practice. PBFD and PDFD model software development as layered directed graphs with unified state machines, verified using Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). This guarantees bounded-refinement termination, deadlock freedom, and structural completeness. To manage hierarchical data at scale, we present the Three-Level Encapsulation (TLE)-a novel bitmask-based encoding scheme. TLE operations are verified via CSP failures-divergences refinement, ensuring constant-time updates and compact storage that underpin PBFD's robust performance. PBFD demonstrates exceptional industrial viability through eight years of enterprise deployment with zero critical failures, achieving approximately 20x faster develop-ment than Salesforce OmniScript, 7-8x faster query performance, and 11.7x storage reduction compared to conventional relational models. These results are established through longitudinal observational studies, quasi-experimental runtime comparisons, and controlled schema-level experiments. Open-source Minimum Viable Product implementations validate key behavioral properties, including bounded refinement and constant-time bitmask operations, un-der reproducible conditions. All implementations, formal specifications, and non-proprietary datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Signi...</summary><p>Significant revision: refined paper structure, updated FDR 4.2.7 machine-checked CSP models, strengthened LTL-based correctness verification, and incorporated a detailed description of the enterprise-grade experimental environment</p></details> |
| **[ReasonX: MLLM-Guided Intrinsic Image Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04222v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic image decomposition aims to separate images into physical components such as albedo, depth, normals, and illumination. While recent diffusion- and transformer-based models benefit from paired supervision from synthetic datasets, their generalization to diverse, real-world scenarios remains challenging. We propose ReasonX, a novel framework that leverages a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a perceptual judge providing relative intrinsic comparisons, and uses these comparisons as GRPO rewards for fine-tuning intrinsic decomposition models on unlabeled, in-the-wild images. Unlike RL methods for generative models, our framework aligns conditional intrinsic predictors by rewarding agreement between the judge's relational assessments and analytically derived relations from the model's outputs. ReasonX is model-agnostic and can be applied to different intrinsic predictors. Across multiple base architectures and modalities, ReasonX yields significant improvements, including 9-25% WHDR reduction on IIW albedo and up to 46% depth accuracy gains on ETH3D, highlighting the promise of MLLM-guided comparative supervision to bridge low- and high-level vision reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On GRPO Collapse in Search-R1: The Lazy Likelihood-Displacement Death Spiral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04220v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-integrated (TI) reinforcement learning (RL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning by interacting with external tools such as search engines and retrievers. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B. Our results establish LLD as a fundamental bottleneck in GRPO-based TIRL and provide a practical path toward stable, scalable training of tool-integrated LLM.</p></details> |  |

| **[Approximate Optimal Active Learning of Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03971v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of actively learning an unknown binary decision tree using only membership queries, a setting in which the learner must reason about a large hypothesis space while maintaining formal guarantees. Rather than enumerating candidate trees or relying on heuristic impurity or entropy measures, we encode the entire space of bounded-depth decision trees symbolically in SAT formulas. We propose a symbolic method for active learning of decision trees, in which approximate model counting is used to estimate the reduction of the hypothesis space caused by each potential query, enabling near-optimal query selection without full model enumeration. The resulting learner incrementally strengthens a CNF representation based on observed query outcomes, and approximate model counter ApproxMC is invoked to quantify the remaining version space in a sound and scalable manner. Additionally, when ApproxMC stagnates, a functional equivalence check is performed to verify that all remaining hypotheses are functionally identical. Experiments on decision trees show that the method reliably converges to the correct model using only a handful of queries, while retaining a rigorous SAT-based foundation suitable for formal analysis and verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Foundations of Fuzzy Simplicial Sets for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03899v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzy simplicial sets have become an object of interest in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, most prominently through their role in UMAP. However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages (including appendix), 11 figures</p></details> |

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaScope: Coarse-to-Fine Scoping for Efficient Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00647v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is further exacerbated when the same fine-grained token processing is uniformly applied across all images regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing: simple images can be effectively handled at a coarse resolution, while only complex ones require refinement. Based on this insight, we propose MambaScope, an adaptive framework for efficient inference for Vision Mamba. MambaScope first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover essential visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows MambaScope to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, achieving efficient processing without compromising accuracy. Experiments across various vision tasks demonstrate that MambaScope outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-dimensional sliced inverse regression with endogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15530v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sliced inverse regression (SIR) is a popular sufficient dimension reduction method that identifies a few linear transformations of the covariates without losing regression information with the response. In high-dimensional settings, SIR can be combined with sparsity penalties to achieve sufficient dimension reduction and variable selection simultaneously. Nevertheless, both classical and sparse estimators assume the covariates are exogenous. However, endogeneity can arise in a variety of situations, such as when variables are omitted or are measured with error. In this article, we show such endogeneity invalidates SIR estimators, leading to inconsistent estimation of the true central subspace. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage Lasso SIR estimator, which first constructs a sparse high-dimensional instrumental variables model to obtain fitted values of the covariates spanned by the instruments, and then applies SIR augmented with a Lasso penalty on these fitted values. We establish theoretical bounds for the estimation and selection consistency of the true central subspace for the proposed estimators, allowing the number of covariates and instruments to grow exponentially with the sample size. Simulation studies and applications to two real-world datasets in nutrition and genetics illustrate the superior empirical performance of the two-stage Lasso SIR estimator compared with existing methods that disregard endogeneity and/or nonlinearity in the outcome model.</p></details> | 61 pages |

However, existing methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D occupancy generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality dynamic 4D scenes with semantics. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D occupancy generation methods across multiple metrics. The code and models have been released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight; 35 pages, 18 figures, 15 tables; Project Page at https://dynamic-city.github.io/</p></details> |

When fusing multiple diarization systems, DOVER-Lap remains the only established approach, operating at the segment level with hard decisions. We propose working with continuous probability outputs, which enables more sophisticated fusion and calibration techniques that can leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing EEND models at the probability level. We investigate two output formulations (multilabel and powerset representations) and their impact on calibration and fusion effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark, we demonstrate that proper calibration provides substantial improvements even for individual models (up to 19% relative DER reduction), in some cases mitigating the absence of domain adaptation. We reveal that joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration, that fusion substantially improves over individual models, and that the Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms both calibrating before fusion and uncalibrated fusion while requiring calibration of only a single combined model. Our best configuration outperforms DOVER-Lap in terms of DER while providing reliable confidence estimates essential for downstream applications. This work proposes best practices for probability-level fusion of EEND systems and demonstrates the advantages of leveraging soft outputs over hard decisions.</p></details> |  |

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |

This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.</p></details> |  |

We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 tables |

This enables early detection of deviations and supports timely control actions to ensure optimal cell growth and product quality. BPM plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, the development of accurate soft sensors for BPM is hindered by key challenges, including limited historical data, infrequent feedback, heterogeneous process conditions, and high-dimensional sensory inputs. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of machine learning (ML) methods designed to address these challenges, with a focus on learning from historical data with limited volume and relevance in the context of bioprocess monitoring. We evaluate multiple ML approaches including feature dimensionality reduction, online learning, and just-in-time learning across three datasets, one in silico dataset and two real-world experimental datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of training strategies in handling limited data and feedback, with batch learning proving effective in homogeneous settings, while just-in-time learning and online learning demonstrate superior adaptability in cold-start scenarios. Additionally, we identify key meta-features, such as feed media composition and process control strategies, that significantly impact model transferability. The results also suggest that integrating Raman-based predictions with lagged offline measurements enhances monitoring accuracy, offering a promising direction for future bioprocess soft sensor development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a pre-print for submitting to computers & chemical engineering journal</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics while generating up to 39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more than 8,000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to two out-of-distribution tasks, namely GPQA and Countdown, with up to 45% and 65% reduction in average sequential tokens respectively for longer reasoning trajectories, while matching the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025.

Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2).

We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted for ICML 2026</p></details> |

Traditional bias correction via data assimilation improves constrained simulations but offers limited benefit once models run freely. We introduce an operator-learning framework that maps instantaneous model states to bias-correction tendencies and applies them online during integration. Building on a U-Net backbone, we develop two operator architectures Inception U-Net (IUNet) and a multi-scale network (M\&M) that combine diverse upsampling and receptive fields to capture multiscale nonlinear features under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) runtime constraints. Trained on two years E3SM simulations nudged toward ERA5 reanalysis, the operators generalize across height levels and seasons. Both architectures outperform standard U-Net baselines in offline tests, indicating that functional richness rather than parameter count drives performance. In online hybrid E3SM runs, M\&M delivers the most consistent bias reductions across variables and vertical levels. The ML-augmented configurations remain stable and computationally feasible in multi-year simulations, providing a practical pathway for scalable hybrid modeling. Our framework emphasizes long-term stability, portability, and cadence-limited updates, demonstrating the utility of expressive ML operators for learning structured, cross-scale relationships and retrofitting legacy ESMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Process Reward Models are Symbolic Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03126v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lockpicking LLMs: A Logit-Based Jailbreak Using Token-level Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13068v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing, but they remain susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that exploit their capabilities to generate unintended and potentially harmful content. Existing token-level jailbreaking techniques, while effective, face scalability and efficiency challenges, especially as models undergo frequent updates and incorporate advanced defensive measures. In this paper, we introduce JailMine, an innovative token-level manipulation approach that addresses these limitations effectively. JailMine employs an automated "mining" process to elicit malicious responses from LLMs by strategically selecting affirmative outputs and iteratively reducing the likelihood of rejection. Through rigorous testing across multiple well-known LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate JailMine's effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a significant average reduction of 86% in time consumed while maintaining high success rates averaging 95%, even in the face of evolving defensive strategies. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to assess and mitigate the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks, underscoring the importance of continued vigilance and proactive measures to enhance the security and reliability of these powerful language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DYNEMO-SLAM: Dynamic Entity and Motion-Aware 3D Scene Graph SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02050v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in dynamic environments face significant challenges due to the presence of moving agents and displaced objects. Traditional SLAM systems typically assume a static world or treat dynamic as outliers, discarding their information to preserve map consistency. As a result, they cannot exploit dynamic entities as persistent landmarks, do not model and exploit their motion over time, and therefore quickly degrade in highly cluttered environments with few reliable static features. This paper presents a novel 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic entities into the SLAM backend. Our framework incorporates semantic motion priors and dynamic entity-aware constraints to jointly optimize the robot trajectory, dynamic entity poses, and the surrounding environment structure within a unified graph formulation. In parallel, a dynamic keyframe selection policy and a semantic loop-closure prefiltering step enable the system to remain robust and effective in highly dynamic environments by continuously adapting to scene changes and filtering inconsistent observations. The simulation and real-world experimental results show a 49.97% reduction in ATE compared to the baseline method employed, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating dynamic entities and estimating their poses for improved robustness and richer scene representation in complex scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Uncertainty for Detecting and Correcting Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13813v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate impressive results across diverse tasks but are still known to hallucinate, generating linguistically plausible but incorrect answers to questions. Uncertainty quantification has been proposed as a strategy for hallucination detection, requiring estimates for both global uncertainty (attributed to a batch of responses) and local uncertainty (attributed to individual responses). While recent black-box approaches have shown some success, they often rely on disjoint heuristics or graph-theoretic approximations that lack a unified geometric interpretation. We introduce a geometric framework to address this, based on archetypal analysis of batches of responses sampled with only black-box model access. At the global level, we propose Geometric Volume, which measures the convex hull volume of archetypes derived from response embeddings. At the local level, we propose Geometric Suspicion, which leverages the spatial relationship between responses and these archetypes to rank reliability, enabling hallucination reduction through preferential response selection. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete pairwise comparisons, our approach provides continuous semantic boundary points which have utility for attributing reliability to individual responses. Experiments show that our framework performs comparably to or better than prior methods on short form question-answering datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets where hallucinations carry particularly critical risks. We also provide theoretical justification by proving a link between convex hull volume and entropy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision.

Linear constraints are useful in a wide range of applications, allowing the fitting of model with high-dimensional or highly collinear predictors, as well as encoding assumptions on the association between some or all predictors and the response. We propose the constrained iteratively-reweighted least squares (CIRLS) to fit the model, iterating quadratic programs to ensure the coefficient vector remains feasible according to the constraints. Inference for constrained coefficients can be obtained by simulating from a truncated multivariate normal distribution and computing empirical confidence intervals or variance-covariance matrix from the simulated coefficient vectors. We additionally discuss the complexity of a constrained GLM, proposing a measure of expected degrees of freedom which accounts for the stringency of constraints in the reduction of the model degrees of freedom. An extensive simulations study shows that constraining the coefficients introduces some bias to the estimation, but also decreases the estimator variance. This trade-off results in an improved estimator when constraints are chosen appropriately. The simulations also show that our proposed inference results in error in variance estimation and coverage. The proposed framework is illustrated on two case studies, showing its usefulness as well as some of its weaknesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer reviewed publication.

Quality diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to harness this potential, yet their success hinges on appropriate sonic feature representations. Existing QD methods predominantly employ handcrafted descriptors or supervised classifiers, potentially introducing unintended exploration biases and constraining discovery to familiar sonic regions. This work investigates unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for automatically defining and dynamically reconfiguring sonic behaviour spaces during QD search. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders to project high-dimensional audio features onto structured grids for MAP-Elites, implementing dynamic reconfiguration through model retraining at regular intervals. Comparison across two experimental scenarios shows that automatic approaches achieve significantly greater diversity than handcrafted behaviour spaces while avoiding expert-imposed biases. Dynamic behaviour-space reconfiguration maintains evolutionary pressure and prevents stagnation, with PCA proving most effective among the dimensionality reduction techniques. These results contribute to automated sonic discovery systems capable of exploring vast parameter spaces without manual intervention or supervised training constraints.</p></details> |  |

Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.3 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further internal evaluation, we found that the current version does not adequately represent the clarity and completeness that we intend for this work.

Here we introduce $\mathcal{IDK}$-$\mathcal{S}$, a novel $\mathbf{I}$ncremental $\mathbf{D}$istributional $\mathbf{K}$ernel for $\mathbf{S}$treaming anomaly detection that effectively addresses these challenges by creating a new dynamic representation in the kernel mean embedding framework. The superiority of $\mathcal{IDK}$-$\mathcal{S}$ is attributed to two key innovations. First, it inherits the strengths of the Isolation Distributional Kernel, an offline detector that has demonstrated significant performance advantages over foundational methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor due to the use of a data-dependent kernel. Second, it adopts a lightweight incremental update mechanism that significantly reduces computational overhead compared to the naive baseline strategy of performing a full model retraining. This is achieved without compromising detection accuracy, a claim supported by its statistical equivalence to the full retrained model. Our extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathcal{IDK}$-$\mathcal{S}$ achieves superior detection accuracy while operating substantially faster, in many cases by an order of magnitude, than existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables,</p></details> |

Developing foundation models for hypergraphs is challenging due to their distinct data, which includes both vertex features and intricate structural information. We present Hyper-FM, a Hypergraph Foundation Model for multi-domain knowledge extraction, featuring Hierarchical High-Order Neighbor Guided Vertex Knowledge Embedding for vertex feature representation and Hierarchical Multi-Hypergraph Guided Structural Knowledge Extraction for structural information. Additionally, we curate 11 text-attributed hypergraph datasets to advance research between HGNNs and LLMs. Experiments on these datasets show that Hyper-FM outperforms baseline methods by approximately 13.4%, validating our approach. Furthermore, we propose the first scaling law for hypergraph foundation models, demonstrating that increasing domain diversity significantly enhances performance, unlike merely augmenting vertex and hyperedge counts. This underscores the critical role of domain diversity in scaling hypergraph models.</p></details> |  |

Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 22 figures, submitted to PASJ</p></details> |

We provide the first complete characterization of implicit optimization bias for p-norm normalized steepest descent (NSD) and momentum steepest descent (NMD) algorithms in multi-class linear classification with cross-entropy loss. Our key theoretical contribution is proving that these algorithms converge to solutions maximizing the margin with respect to the classifier matrix's p-norm, with established convergence rates. These results encompass important special cases including Spectral Descent and Muon, which we show converge to max-margin solutions with respect to the spectral norm. A key insight of our contribution is that the analysis of general entry-wise and Schatten p-norms can be reduced to the analysis of NSD/NMD with max-norm by exploiting a natural ordering property between all p-norms relative to the max-norm and its dual sum-norm. For the specific case of descent with respect to the max-norm, we further extend our analysis to include preconditioning, showing that Adam converges to the matrix's max-norm solution. Our results demonstrate that the multi-class linear setting, which is inherently richer than the binary counterpart, provides the most transparent framework for studying implicit biases of matrix-parameter optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Interaction Tensor Shap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05338v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have grown increasingly deep and high dimensional, making it difficult to understand how individual and combined features influence their predictions. While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible.</p></details> | 30 pages |

A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.

| **[Beyond KAN: Introducing KarSein for Adaptive High-Order Feature Interaction Modeling in CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08713v6)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling high-order feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, yet traditional approaches typically predefine a maximum interaction order and exhaustively enumerate feature combinations up to that order. This paradigm depends heavily on prior domain knowledge to delimit the interaction space and incurs substantial computational overhead. As a result, conventional CTR models face a persistent tension between enriching representations with complex high-order interactions and keeping computation tractable. To address this dual challenge, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein). Drawing inspiration from the learnable activation mechanism in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), KarSein leverages this mechanism to adaptively transform low-order basic features into high-order feature interactions, offering a novel approach to feature interaction modeling. KarSein extends the capabilities of KAN by introducing a more efficient architecture that significantly reduces computational costs while accommodating two-dimensional embedding vectors as feature inputs. Furthermore, it overcomes the limitation of KAN's its inability to spontaneously capture multiplicative relationships among features. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of KarSein, demonstrating its ability to surpass not only the vanilla implementation of KAN in CTR prediction tasks but also other baseline methods. Remarkably, KarSein achieves exceptional predictive accuracy while maintaining a highly compact parameter size and minimal computational overhead. Moreover, KarSein exhibits strong interpretability and structural sparsity. As the first systematic adaptation of KAN to CTR prediction, KarSein offers a practical, parameter-efficient, and interpretable alternative for modeling complex feature interactions in CTR prediction.</p></details> | Under review by TOIS |

This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[AugServe: Adaptive Request Scheduling for Augmented Large Language Model Inference Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04013v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality. This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[OOPredictor: Predicting Object-Oriented Accesses using Static Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03972v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-oriented Programming has become one of the most dominant design paradigms as the separation of concerns and adaptability of design reduce development and maintenance costs. However, the convenience is not without cost. The added indirection inherent in such designs causes excessive pointer chasing, negatively affecting locality, which in turn degrades the performance of cache structures. Furthermore, modern hardware prefetchers are mostly stride prefetchers that are ill-equipped to handle the unpredictability of access patterns generated by pointer chasing. Most software approaches that seek to address this problem resort to profiling the program as it runs, which comes with a significant run-time overhead or requires data from previous runs. In this paper, we propose the use of compile-time static analysis to predict the most common access patterns displayed by a program during run time. Since Java is one of the most popular object-oriented languages, we implement our prototype within the OpenJ9 JVM, inside the OMR optimizer infrastructure. The outputs of our proposed predictor are Markov chains that model the expected behavior of the program. The effectiveness of the proposed predictor is evaluated by comparing the model with the actual run-time behavior of the program measured using an instrumented interpreter. Our experiments show that the proposed predictor exhibits good accuracy and can be used to inform minimally intrusive load stall mitigation strategies, e.g. informing copying GCs on more locality-friendly copying orders</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Deep Tabular Methods with Temporal Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20260v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep tabular models have demonstrated remarkable success on i.i.d. data, excelling in a variety of structured data tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection performs. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables.

At the same time, these systems must maintain a certain level of determinism to ensure reliable and predictable operation. In this view, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) is a communication technology that meets both conditions, making it an attractive option for its usage in industrial WSNs. This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree. The application of these models on simulated data based on an accurate modeling of wireless sensor nodes indicates that the investigated algorithms can be suitably used to further and substantially reduce the power consumption of a TSCH network.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint accepted, 8 pages, 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches often rely on predefined serialization strategies, which cannot adjust based on diverse geometric structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{DM3D}, a deformable Mamba architecture for point cloud understanding. Specifically, DM3D introduces an offset-guided Gaussian sequencing mechanism that unifies local resampling and global reordering within a deformable scan. The Gaussian-based KNN Resampling (GKR) enhances structural awareness by adaptively reorganizing neighboring points, while the Gaussian-based Differentiable Reordering (GDR) enables end-to-end optimization of serialization order. Furthermore, a Tri-Path Frequency Fusion module enhances feature complementarity and reduces aliasing. Together, these components enable structure-adaptive serialization of point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, few-shot learning, and part segmentation, demonstrating that adaptive serialization effectively unlocks the potential of SSMs for point cloud understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallelizing MCMC Across the Sequence Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18413v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are foundational algorithms for Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling. However, most MCMC algorithms are inherently sequential and their time complexity scales linearly with the sequence length. Previous work on adapting MCMC to modern hardware has therefore focused on running many independent chains in parallel. Here, we take an alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in parallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for parallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence as a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a parallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to parallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the simulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of parallel Newton iterations. Additionally, we develop two new parallel quasi-Newton methods to evaluate nonlinear recursions with lower memory costs and reduced runtime. We find that the proposed parallel algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling across multiple examples, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude compared to sequential evaluation.</p></details> | 36 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Joint Distillation for Fast Likelihood Evaluation and Sampling in Flow-based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02636v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic Structure as a Proxy for Saliency: SVD-Based Weight Preservation for Mixed-Precision Quantization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01343v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable. In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\%) and SpQR (65.34\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.</p></details> |  |
| **[SQLBarber: A System Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Customized and Realistic SQL Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06192v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2026; extended version with appendix</p></details> |

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Here, $\mathsf{u}$ is a scalar function with inverse $\mathsf{s}$, $x^{\ft}\barx$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing of vectors $x, \barx$ belonging to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We compute explicitly the MTW tensor (or cross curvature) for the optimal transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with this cost. The condition that the MTW-tensor vanishes on null vectors under the Kim-McCann metric is a fourth-order nonlinear ODE, which could be reduced to a linear ODE of the form $\mathsf{s}^{(2)} - S\mathsf{s}^{(1)} + P\mathsf{s} = 0$ with constant coefficients $P$ and $S$. The resulting inverse functions include {\it Lambert} and {\it generalized inverse hyperbolic\slash trigonometric} functions. The square Euclidean metric and $\log$-type costs are equivalent to instances of these solutions. The optimal map may be written explicitly in terms of the potential function. For cost functions of a similar form on a hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space and unit sphere, we also express this tensor in terms of algebraic expressions in derivatives of $\mathsf{s}$ using the Gauss-Codazzi equation, obtaining new families of strictly regular costs for these manifolds, including new families of {\it power function costs}. We express the divergence geometry of the $\mathsf{c}$-divergence in terms of the Kim-McCann metric, including a $\mathsf{c}$-Crouzeix identity and a formula for the primal connection. We analyze the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost, providing examples of $\mathsf{c}$-convex functions, which are used to construct a new \emph{local form} of the $α$-divergences on probability simplices. We apply the optimal maps to sample the multivariate $t$-distribution.</p></details> | 40 pages |
| **[Improved Disease Outbreak Detection from Out-of-sequence measurements Using Markov-switching Fixed-lag Particle Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01639v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle filters (PFs) have become an essential tool for disease surveillance, as they can estimate hidden epidemic states in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. In epidemic modelling, population dynamics may be governed by distinct regimes such as endemic or outbreak phases which can be represented using Markov-switching state-space models. In many real-world surveillance systems, data often arrives with delays or in the wrong temporal order, producing out-of-sequence (OOS) measurements that pertain to past time points rather than the current one. While existing PF methods can incorporate OOS measurements through particle reweighting, these approaches are limited in their ability to fully adjust past latent trajectories. To address this, we introduce a Markov-switching fixed-lag particle filter (FL-PF) that resimulates particle trajectories within a user-specified lag window, allowing OOS measurements to retroactively update both state and model estimates. By explicitly reevaluating historical samples, the FL-PF improves the accuracy and timeliness of outbreak detection and reduces false alarms. We also show how to compute the log-likelihood within the FL-PF framework, enabling parameter estimation using Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$). Together, these contributions extend the applicability of PFs to surveillance systems where retrospective data are common, offering a more robust framework for monitoring disease outbreaks and parameter inference.</p></details> | 23 Pages |

Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.</p></details> |  |

We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\text{Re}\in\{10, 15, 20\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids. The approach is general and applicable to other explicit solvers requiring GPU-resident geometry embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 31 figures, 9 tables, 6 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01081v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>add a...</summary><p>add an author[Update], 12 pages, 5 figures, accepted at LAW 2025 Workshop (NeurIPS 2025) Project page: https://deeppersona-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach consistently improves upon the Hadamard transform for common formats.</p></details> |  |

PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the GP update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that PFNs are backbone architecture invariant and the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN, RNN and LSTM-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of E-03, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[City-Conditioned Memory for Multi-City Traffic and Mobility Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00851v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes. We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks). Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638v4)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two cases of such divergences: "harmless" divergences that occur in the behavioral null-space of the layer(s) of interest, and "pernicious" divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we apply and modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) allowing representations from causal interventions to remain closer to the natural distribution, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of the interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMamDiff: Spatial Mamba for Stochastic Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00355v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With intelligent room-side sensing and service robots widely deployed, human motion prediction (HMP) is essential for safe, proactive assistance. However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting and Sampling Traces in Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00314v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the problems of counting and sampling Mazurkiewicz traces that a regular language touches. Fix an alphabet $Σ$ and an independence relation $\mathbb{I} \subseteq Σ\times Σ$. The input consists of a regular language $L \subseteq Σ^*$, given by a finite automaton with $m$ states, and a natural number $n$ (in unary). For the counting problem, the goal is to compute the number of Mazurkiewicz traces (induced by $\mathbb{I}$) that intersect the $n^\text{th}$ slice $L_n = L \cap Σ^n$, i.e., traces that admit at least one linearization in $L_n$. For the sampling problem, the goal is to output a trace drawn from a distribution that is approximately uniform over all such traces. These tasks are motivated by bounded model checking with partial-order reduction, where an \emph{a priori} estimate of the reduced state space is valuable, and by testing methods for concurrent programs that use partial-order-aware random exploration. We first show that the counting problem is #P-hard even when $L$ is accepted by a deterministic automaton, in sharp contrast to counting words of a DFA, which is polynomial-time solvable. We then prove that the problem lies in #P for both NFAs and DFAs, irrespective of whether $L$ is trace-closed. Our main algorithmic contributions are a \emph{fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme} (FPRAS) that, with high probability, approximates the desired count within a prescribed accuracy, and a \emph{fully polynomial-time almost uniform sampler} (FPAUS) that generates traces whose distribution is provably close to uniform.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in POPL 2026.

A poorly selected polynomial order results in over- or under-smoothing which shows as either bias or excessive noise at the output. In this study, we apply the N-fold cross-validation technique (also known as leave-one-out cross-validation) for model order selection and show that the inherent analytical structure of the SG filtering problem, mainly its minimum norm formulation, enables an efficient and effective order selection solution. More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method. The suggested solution compares favorably with the state-of-the-art Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) rule in non-asymptotic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sample size regimes.

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |

This allows high-maneuverability tasks like quick cornering, and steady-state drifting control enhances motion stability under lateral slip conditions. While drifting has been successfully achieved in four-wheeled robot systems, its application to single-track two-wheeled (STTW) robots, such as unmanned motorcycles or bicycles, has not been thoroughly studied. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the drifting equilibrium theory to STTW robots and reveals the mechanism behind the steady-state drifting maneuver. Notably, the counter-steering drifting technique used by skilled motorcyclists is explained through this theory. In addition, an analytical algorithm based on intrinsic geometry and kinematics relationships is proposed, reducing the computation time by four orders of magnitude while maintaining less than 6% error compared to numerical methods. Based on equilibrium analysis, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to achieve steady-state drifting and equilibrium points transition, with its effectiveness and robustness validated through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Standard calibration metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the forecast quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22793v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel state information (CSI) is essential for adaptive beamforming and maintaining robust links in wireless communication systems. However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

| **[Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $τ$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $τ$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $θ$-Trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GSM8K-level math-reasoning, GPT-2-level text, and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints, with consistent performance gains across models ranging from 200M to 8B.

| **[Test Time Training for AC Power Flow Surrogates via Physics and Operational Constraint Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22343v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Collapse of Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22281v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[The Evolution of Trust under Institutional Moral Hazard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21875v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of for-profit institutions that broadcast reputations to foster trust among market participants. We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system. These findings highlight the intricate tensions between platform incentives and resulting social utility for marketplace participants.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

While edge-based MPNNs effectively capture local interactions, their expressive power is theoretically bounded, limiting the discovery of higher-order relationships. We introduce the Higher-Order Graph Attention (HoGA) module, which constructs a k-order attention matrix by sampling subgraphs to maximize diversity among feature vectors. Unlike existing higher-order attention methods that greedily resample similar k-order relationships, HoGA targets diverse modalities in higher-order topology, reducing redundancy and expanding the range of captured substructures. Applied to two single-hop attention models, HoGA achieves at least a 5% accuracy gain on all benchmark node classification datasets and outperforms recent baselines on six of eight datasets.

Each problem is fully parameterized, supporting an effectively infinite range of input configurations, and is accompanied by structured, step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code that produces the ground-truth solution for any parameter set. The benchmark contains three question types: MC-Symbolic (multiple-choice with symbolic options), MC-Numerical (multiple-choice with numerical options), and free-form (open-ended responses). These diverse formats test complementary reasoning skills. By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models reveal both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning, positioning SymPyBench as a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems</p></details> |  |

| **[DAE-HardNet: A Physics Constrained Neural Network Enforcing Differential-Algebraic Hard Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05881v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not always satisfy physics based constraints, especially when the constraints include differential operators. Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet.</p></details> |  |

Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.</p></details> |  |

In such systems, end-to-end user requests traverse multiple different services and machines, exhibiting intricate interactions. Consequently, cloud service systems are vulnerable to concurrency bugs, which pose significant challenges to their reliability. Existing methods for concurrency bug detection often fall short due to their intrusive nature and inability to handle the architectural complexities of microservices. To address these limitations, we propose MicroRacer, a non-intrusive and automated framework for detecting concurrency bugs in such environments. By dynamically instrumenting widely-used libraries at runtime, MicroRacer collects detailed trace data without modifying the application code. Such data are utilized to analyze the happened-before relationship and resource access patterns of common operations within service systems. Based on this information, MicroRacer identifies suspicious concurrent operations and employs a three-stage validation process to test and confirm concurrency bugs. Experiments on open-source microservice benchmarks with replicated industrial bugs demonstrate MicroRacer's effectiveness and efficiency in accurately detecting and pinpointing concurrency issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metronome: Differentiated Delay Scheduling for Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Control Perspective on Training PINNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18582v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) from a control-theoretic perspective. Using gradient descent with resampling, we interpret the training dynamics as asymptotically equivalent to a stochastic control-affine system, where sampling effects act as process disturbances and measurement noise. Within this framework, we introduce two controllers for dynamically adapting the physics weight: an integral controller and a leaky integral controller. We theoretically analyze their asymptotic properties under the accuracy-robustness trade-off, and we evaluate them on a toy example. Numerical evidence suggests that the integral controller achieves accurate and robust convergence when the physical model is correct, whereas the leaky integrator provides improved performance in the presence of model mismatch. This work represents a first step toward convergence guarantees and principled training algorithms tailored to the distinct characteristics of PINN tasks.</p></details> |  |

Real-time detection and interpretation of facial expressions have become increasingly important for various applications, from user experience personalization to intelligent surveillance systems. This study presents a novel approach to real-time sequential facial expression recognition using deep learning and geometric features. The proposed method utilizes MediaPipe FaceMesh for rapid and accurate facial landmark detection. Geometric features, including Euclidean distances and angles, are extracted from these landmarks. Temporal dynamics are incorporated by analyzing feature differences between consecutive frames, enabling the detection of onset, apex, and offset phases of expressions. For classification, a ConvLSTM1D network followed by multilayer perceptron blocks is employed. The method's performance was evaluated on multiple publicly available datasets, including CK+, Oulu-CASIA (VIS and NIR), and MMI. Accuracies of 93%, 79%, 77%, and 68% were achieved respectively. Experiments with composite datasets were also conducted to assess the model's generalization capabilities. The approach demonstrated real-time applicability, processing approximately 165 frames per second on consumer-grade hardware. This research contributes to the field of facial expression analysis by providing a fast, accurate, and adaptable solution. The findings highlight the potential for further advancements in emotion-aware technologies and personalized user experiences, paving the way for more sophisticated human-computer interaction systems.

DIPs are generalizations of unique implication points and can be informally viewed as a pair of dominator nodes, from the decision variable at the highest decision level to the conflict node, in an implication graph. We perform extensive experimental evaluation to establish the efficacy of our ERCL method, implemented as part of the MapleLCM SAT solver and dubbed xMapleLCM, against several leading solvers including the baseline MapleLCM, as well as CDCL solvers such as Kissat 3.1.1, CryptoMiniSat 5.11, and SBVA+CaDiCaL, the winner of SAT Competition 2023. We show that xMapleLCM outperforms these solvers on Tseitin and XORified formulas. We further compare xMapleLCM with GlucoseER, a system that implements extended resolution in a different way, and provide a detailed comparative analysis of their performance.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.</p></details> |  |

However, its integration with robotic grasping systems has so far been explored due to the deployment complexities and prohibitive costs. Within this paper, we introduce a novel hyperspectral imaging-guided robotic grasping system. The system consists of PRISM (Polyhedral Reflective Imaging Scanning Mechanism) and the SpectralGrasp framework. PRISM is designed to enable high-precision, distortion-free hyperspectral imaging while simplifying system integration and costs. SpectralGrasp generates robotic grasping strategies by effectively leveraging both the spatial and spectral information from hyperspectral images. The proposed system demonstrates substantial improvements in both textile recognition compared to human performance and sorting success rate compared to RGB-based methods. Additionally, a series of comparative experiments further validates the effectiveness of our system. The study highlights the potential benefits of integrating hyperspectral imaging with robotic grasping systems, showcasing enhanced recognition and grasping capabilities in complex and dynamic environments.

| **[Relational Dissonance in Human-AI Interactions: The Case of Knowledge Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15836v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI systems allow human-like communication, they elicit increasingly complex relational responses. Knowledge workers face a particular challenge: They approach these systems as tools while interacting with them in ways that resemble human social interaction. To understand the relational contexts that arise when humans engage with anthropomorphic conversational agents, we need to expand existing human-computer interaction frameworks. Through three workshops with qualitative researchers, we found that the fundamental ontological and relational ambiguities inherent in anthropomorphic conversational agents make it difficult for individuals to maintain consistent relational stances toward them. Our findings indicate that people's articulated positioning toward such agents often differs from the relational dynamics that occur during interactions. We propose the concept of relational dissonance to help researchers, designers, and policymakers recognize the resulting tensions in the development, deployment, and governance of anthropomorphic conversational agents and address the need for relational transparency.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-state Modeling of Delay Evolution in Suburban Rail Transports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05521v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Train delays are a persistent issue in railway systems, particularly in suburban networks where operational complexity is heightened by frequent services and high passenger volumes. Traditional delay models often overlook the temporal and structural dynamics of real delay propagation. This work applies continuous-time multi-state models to analyze the temporal evolution of delay on the S5 suburban line in Lombardy, Italy. Using detailed operational, meteorological, and contextual data, the study models delay transitions while accounting for observable heterogeneity. The findings reveal how delay dynamics vary by travel direction, time slot, and route segment. Covariates such as station saturation and passenger load are shown to significantly affect the risk of delay escalation or recovery. The study offers both methodological advancements and practical results for improving the reliability of rail services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Infrared Small Target Detection: A Foundation-Driven Efficient Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05511v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large-scale visual foundation models (VFMs) exhibit strong generalization across diverse visual domains, their potential for single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically introduce the frozen representations from VFMs into the SIRST task for the first time and propose a Foundation-Driven Efficient Paradigm (FDEP), which can seamlessly adapt to existing encoder-decoder-based methods and significantly improve accuracy without additional inference overhead. Specifically, a Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module is designed to achieve dynamic alignment and deep fusion of the global semantic priors from VFMs with task-specific features. Meanwhile, to avoid the inference time burden introduced by VFMs, we propose a Collaborative Optimization-based Implicit Self-Distillation (CO-ISD) strategy, which enables implicit semantic transfer between the main and lightweight branches through parameter sharing and synchronized backpropagation. In addition, to unify the fragmented evaluation system, we construct a Holistic SIRST Evaluation (HSE) metric that performs multi-threshold integral evaluation at both pixel-level confidence and target-level robustness, providing a stable and comprehensive basis for fair model comparison. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SIRST detection networks equipped with our FDEP framework achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets.

Addressing this gap, our study examines the benefits and limitations of using LLMs as real-time learning support, considering how classroom constraints, such as diverse proficiency levels and limited time, affect their effectiveness. We conducted a deployment study with 157 eighth-grade students in a South Korean middle school English class over six weeks. Our findings reveal that while scaffolding improved students' ability to compose grammatically correct sentences, this step-by-step approach demotivated lower-proficiency students and increased their system reliance. We also observed challenges to classroom dynamics, where extroverted students often dominated the teacher's attention, and the system's assistance made it difficult for teachers to identify struggling students. Based on these findings, we discuss design guidelines for integrating LLMs into real-time writing classes as inclusive educational tools.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Real-Time Execution of Action Chunking Flow Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07339v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world, increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method, real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and "inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast, performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the presence of significant latency.

However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench.</p></details> |  |

While previous recurrent neural network-based and attention-based approaches have achieved significant results, they have limitations in capturing system continuity due to the discrete characteristics. In the context of continuous-time modeling, state space model (SSM) offers a potential solution, as it can effectively capture the dynamic evolution of user interest over time. However, existing SSM-based approaches ignore the impact of irregular time intervals within historical user interactions, making it difficult to model complexed user-item transitions in sequences. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid SSM-based model called SS4Rec for continuous-time sequential recommendation. SS4Rec integrates a time-aware SSM to handle irregular time intervals and a relation-aware SSM to model contextual dependencies, enabling it to infer user interest from both temporal and sequential perspectives. In the training process, the time-aware SSM and the relation-aware SSM are discretized by variable stepsizes according to user interaction time intervals and input data, respectively. This helps capture the continuous dependency from irregular time intervals and provides time-specific personalized recommendations. Experimental studies on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of SS4Rec.</p></details> |  |

However, as AI systems progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), such value systems may become insufficient. In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns the model to CA while preserving general NLP capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, to appear in AAAI 2026 AIGOV Workshop</p></details> |

We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines eight real-world deployments spanning seven countries and 18 languages, combining 17 interviews with AI developers and domain experts with secondary research. Our findings identify six cross-cutting factors - Language, Institution, Safety, Task, End-User Demography, and Domain - that structured how systems were designed and deployed. These factors were shaped by Sociocultural (diversity, practices), Institutional (resources, policies), and Technological (capabilities, limits) influences. We find that building effective AI systems required extensive collaboration between AI developers and domain experts, with human resources proving more critical to achieving safe and effective outcomes in high-stakes domains than technological expertise alone. Additionally, we present 12 guidelines synthesizing these dynamics for designing AI for social good systems that are culturally grounded, equitable, and responsive to the needs of non-Western contexts.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains. This work offers practical insights for deploying high-performance, scalable document retrieval solutions in enterprise settings, demonstrating that metadata enrichment is a powerful approach for enhancing RAG effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We challenge the naive assumption that linguistic change is simplification by quantitatively analyzing over 2,000 years of Sanskrit, demonstrating how weakly-supervised hybrid methods can yield new insights into the evolution of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT. We then fuse symbolic and neural outputs via a novel confidence-weighted ensemble, creating a system that is both scalable and interpretable. Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology. Critically, our system produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, with confidence strongly correlating with accuracy (Pearson r = 0.92) and low overall calibration error (ECE = 0.043), bolstering the reliability of these findings for computational philology.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method integrates two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames, our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies, such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ROBOVIS 2026</p></details> |

| **[A Practical Honeypot-Based Threat Intelligence Framework for Cyber Defence in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05321v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cloud environments, conventional firewalls rely on predefined rules and manual configurations, limiting their ability to respond effectively to evolving or zero-day threats. As organizations increasingly adopt platforms such as Microsoft Azure, this static defense model exposes cloud assets to zero-day exploits, botnets, and advanced persistent threats. In this paper, we introduce an automated defense framework that leverages medium- to high-interaction honeypot telemetry to dynamically update firewall rules in real time. The framework integrates deception sensors (Cowrie), Azure-native automation tools (Monitor, Sentinel, Logic Apps), and MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detection within a closed-loop feedback mechanism. We developed a testbed to automatically observe adversary tactics, classify them using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and mitigate network-level threats automatically with minimal human intervention. To assess the framework's effectiveness, we defined and applied a set of attack- and defense-oriented security metrics. Building on existing adaptive defense strategies, our solution extends automated capabilities into cloud-native environments. The experimental results show an average Mean Time to Block of 0.86 seconds - significantly faster than benchmark systems - while accurately classifying over 12,000 SSH attempts across multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics. These findings demonstrate that integrating deception telemetry with Azure-native automation reduces attacker dwell time, enhances SOC visibility, and provides a scalable, actionable defense model for modern cloud infrastructures.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[WhatsCode: Large-Scale GenAI Deployment for Developer Efficiency at WhatsApp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05314v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of AI-assisted development tools in compliance-relevant, large-scale industrial environments represents significant gaps in academic literature, despite growing industry adoption. We report on the industrial deployment of WhatsCode, a domain-specific AI development system that supports WhatsApp (serving over 2 billion users) and processes millions of lines of code across multiple platforms. Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes. WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success. The findings provide evidence-based guidance for large-scale AI tool deployment in compliance-relevant environments, showing that effective human-AI collaboration, not full automation, drives sustainable business impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 48th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice</p></details> |
| **[Disturbance Compensation for Safe Kinematic Control of Robotic Systems with Closed Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05292v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art.

| **[XR-DT: Extended Reality-Enhanced Digital Twin for Agentic Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05270v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans in shared workspaces, ensuring safe, efficient, and interpretable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a pressing challenge. While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Empowered Task Offloading in V2I Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11352v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing plays an essential role in the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks, where vehicles offload their intensive computation tasks to the road-side units for saving energy and reduce the latency. This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will not be further developed or submitted for publication, so we withdraw the manuscript from arXiv</p></details> |
| **[NVLang: Unified Static Typing for Actor-Based Concurrency on the BEAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05224v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-based systems like Erlang/OTP power critical infrastructure -- from telecommunications to messaging platforms -- handling millions of concurrent connections with legendary reliability. Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures. We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns. By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem. We formalize the type system and provide proof sketches for type soundness, demonstrating that well-typed NVLang programs cannot send messages that violate actor protocols.</p></details> | 4 figures, 2 tables |
| **[Detecting Perspective Shifts in Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05013v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models augmented with external tools and update mechanisms (or \textit{agents}) have demonstrated capabilities beyond intelligent prompting of base models. As agent use proliferates, dynamic multi-agent systems have naturally emerged. Recent work has investigated the theoretical and empirical properties of low-dimensional representations of agents based on query responses at a single time point. This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly embeds agents across time, and proposes several novel hypothesis tests for detecting behavioral change at the agent- and group-level in black-box multi-agent systems. We characterize the empirical properties of our proposed tests, including their sensitivity to key hyperparameters, in simulations motivated by a multi-agent system of evolving digital personas. Finally, we demonstrate via natural experiment that our proposed tests detect changes that correlate sensitively, specifically, and significantly with a real exogenous event. As far as we are aware, TDKPS is the first principled framework for monitoring behavioral dynamics in black-box multi-agent systems -- a critical capability as generative agent deployment continues to scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[A dynamic memory assignment strategy for dilation-based ICP algorithm on embedded GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04996v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a memory-efficient optimization strategy for the high-performance point cloud registration algorithm VANICP, enabling lightweight execution on embedded GPUs with constrained hardware resources. VANICP is a recently published acceleration framework that significantly improves the computational efficiency of point-cloud-based applications. By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.
