| **[DeepKoopFormer: A Koopman Enhanced Transformer Based Architecture for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02616v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and dynamical settings.</p></details> |  |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02410v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time series specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICML 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[HGTS-Former: Hierarchical HyperGraph Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02411v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold-regularised Large-Margin $\ell_p$-SVDD for Multidimensional Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23449v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising for time series anomaly detection. Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation technique for the proposed method. We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its performance against other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02198v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional financial time series often exhibit complex dependence relations driven by both common market structures and latent connections among assets. To capture these characteristics, this paper proposes Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (FNIRVAR), a model for the common and idiosyncratic components of high-dimensional time series with an underlying unobserved network structure. The common component is modelled by a static factor model, which allows for strong cross-sectional dependence, whilst a network vector autoregressive process captures the residual co-movements due to the idiosyncratic component. An assortative stochastic block model underlies the network VAR, leading to groups of highly co-moving variables in the idiosyncratic component. For estimation, a two-step procedure is proposed, whereby the static factors are estimated via principal component analysis, followed by estimation of the network VAR parameters. The method is demonstrated in financial applications to daily returns, intraday returns, and FRED-MD macroeconomic variables. In all cases, the proposed method outperforms a static factor model, as well as a static factor plus LASSO-estimated sparse VAR model, in terms of forecasting and financial performance metrics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SpikeSTAG: Spatial-Temporal Forecasting via GNN-SNN Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02069v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[IFD: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Insider Filing Violation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20162v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider trading violations, particularly delayed disclosures of Form 4 filings, remain a persistent challenge for financial market surveillance. Despite regulatory requirements such as the two-business-day rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcement is limited by the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets and task-specific benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the Insider Filing Delay (IFD) dataset, the first and largest publicly available resource for insider disclosure behavior, comprising over one million Form 4 transactions spanning two decades (2002 to 2025), with structured annotations on delay status, insider roles, governance factors, and firm-level financial indicators. IFD enables the first large-scale formulation of strategic disclosure violation detection as a binary classification task grounded in regulatory compliance. To demonstrate the utility of IFD, we propose MaBoost, a hybrid framework combining a Mamba-based state space encoder with XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in identifying high-risk behavioral patterns. Experiments across statistical baselines, deep learning models, and large language models confirm that MaBoost outperforms prior approaches, achieving an F1 score of up to 99.47 percent under constrained regulatory settings. IFD provides a realistic, reproducible, and behavior-rich dataset for developing AI models in financial compliance, regulatory forensics, and interpretable time series classification. All data and codes are available at: https://github.com/CH-YellowOrange/MaBoost-and-IFD.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchAD: A Lightweight Patch-based MLP-Mixer for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09793v6)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a pivotal task in data analysis, yet it poses the challenge of discerning normal and abnormal patterns in label-deficient scenarios. While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limit the models' representational capacities. Moreover, existing deep learning-based methods are not sufficiently lightweight. Addressing these issues, we present PatchAD, our novel, highly efficient multiscale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that utilizes contrastive learning for representation extraction and anomaly detection. With its four distinct MLP Mixers and innovative dual project constraint module, PatchAD mitigates potential model degradation and offers a lightweight solution, requiring only $0.403M$ parameters. Its efficacy is demonstrated by state-of-the-art results across $8$ datasets sourced from different application scenarios, outperforming over $30$ comparative algorithms. PatchAD significantly improves the classical F1 score by 6.84%, the Aff-F1 score by 4.27%, and the V-ROC by 2.49%. Simultaneously, an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying PatchAD has been conducted from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, validating the design motivations of the model. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/EmorZz1G/PatchAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures, 13 tables, TBD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01971v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[CITS: Nonparametric Statistical Causal Modeling for High-Resolution Neural Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01920v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how signals propagate through neural circuits is central to deciphering brain computation. While functional connectivity captures statistical associations, it does not reveal directionality or causal mechanisms. We introduce CITS (Causal Inference in Time Series), a non-parametric method for inferring statistically causal neural circuitry from high-resolution time series data. CITS models neural dynamics using a structural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged conditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics. Unlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models and Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and no temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially non-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures. We prove consistency under mild mixing assumptions and validate CITS on simulated linear, nonlinear, and continuous-time recurrent neural network data, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We then apply CITS to Neuropixels recordings from mouse brain during visual tasks. CITS uncovers interpretable, stimulus-specific causal circuits linking cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions, consistent with experimental literature. It also reveals that neurons with similar orientation selectivity indices are more likely to be causally connected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CITS in uncovering biologically meaningful pathways and generating hypotheses for future experimental studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.09604</p></details> |
| **[Constructing prediction intervals for the age distribution of deaths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17953v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model-agnostic procedure to construct prediction intervals for the age distribution of deaths. The age distribution of deaths is an example of constrained data, which are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. A centered log-ratio transformation and a cumulative distribution function transformation are used to remove the two constraints, where the latter transformation can also handle the presence of zero counts. Our general procedure divides data samples into training, validation, and testing sets. Within the validation set, we can select an optimal tuning parameter by calibrating the empirical coverage probabilities to be close to their nominal ones. With the selected optimal tuning parameter, we then construct the pointwise prediction intervals using the same models for the holdout data in the testing set. Using Japanese age- and sex-specific life-table death counts, we assess and evaluate the interval forecast accuracy with a suite of functional time-series models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series through Mutual Information Featurization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01848v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics. This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for uncovering causal structures in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Predictive Control to Coordinate Discrete- and Continuous-Time Models for Time-Series Analysis with Control-Theoretical Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01833v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis, such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation, extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and (2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics. During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, submitted to ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |
| **[Informed Forecasting: Leveraging Auxiliary Knowledge to Boost LLM Performance on Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10213v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Fuse Temporal Proximity Networks: A Case Study in Chimpanzee Social Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00302v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency for consecutive time steps. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing High-dimensional Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06126v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we first establish the joint central limit theorem (CLT) for the extreme eigenvalues of the sample correlation matrix of high-dimensional random walks with cross-sectional dependence. We further investigate the asymptotic spectral properties of the sample correlation matrix of high-dimensional autoregressive processes. To apply our theoretical results, we propose a novel high-dimensional unit root test and develop a forward sequential test to determine the number of unit roots in high-dimensional time series data. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantically-Guided Inference for Conditional Diffusion Models: Enhancing Covariate Consistency in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01761v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Generated Text is Non-Stationary: Detection via Temporal Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01754v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Temporal-Aware Multi-Modal Retrieval Augmented Generation in Finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05185v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different financial analysis tasks designed by domain experts, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Accepted by MM 2025 |
| **[A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning for Any Atlas and Disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01727v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MHARFedLLM: Multimodal Human Activity Recognition Using Federated Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01701v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras, limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance, achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of 0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and robust HAR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEAT: Balanced Frequency Adaptive Tuning for Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19065v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is crucial for numerous real-world applications including weather prediction and financial market modeling. While temporal-domain methods remain prevalent, frequency-domain approaches can effectively capture multi-scale periodic patterns, reduce sequence dependencies, and naturally denoise signals. However, existing approaches typically train model components for all frequencies under a unified training objective, often leading to mismatched learning speeds: high-frequency components converge faster and risk overfitting, while low-frequency components underfit due to insufficient training time. To deal with this challenge, we propose BEAT (Balanced frEquency Adaptive Tuning), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the training status for each frequency and adaptively adjusts their gradient updates. By recognizing convergence, overfitting, or underfitting for each frequency, BEAT dynamically reallocates learning priorities, moderating gradients for rapid learners and increasing those for slower ones, alleviating the tension between competing objectives across frequencies and synchronizing the overall learning process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks. Building on CSI-BERT, we introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. We also introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based temporal embedding module to mitigate permutation invariance issues in time-series CSI data. This significantly improves the CSI classification performance of the original CSI-BERT model. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address.</p></details> |  |
| **[KANMixer: Can KAN Serve as a New Modeling Core for Long-term Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01575v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures. Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore, we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively leveraging KAN in LTSF.

While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes, trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions, NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original training objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Constrained Learning for Long-Term Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01508v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover, on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies, further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent periodic patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[HT-Transformer: Event Sequences Classification by Accumulating Prefix Information with History Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01474v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, contextual information, and representative time-series examples through extensive case studies. Extensive experiments on the REDD and UK-DALE datasets show that LLMs guided solely by prompts deliver only basic NILM capabilities, with performance that lags behind traditional deep-learning models in complex scenarios. However, the experiments also demonstrate strong generalization across different houses and even regions by simply adapting the injected appliance features. It also provides clear, human-readable explanations for the inferred appliance states. Our findings define the capability boundaries of using prompt-only LLMs for NILM tasks. Their strengths in generalization and explainability present a promising new direction for the field.</p></details> |  |

While many existing state-of-practice methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static, costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model (GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset, METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data analysis in weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Non-p...</summary><p>Non-peer-reviewed Preprint | Keywords: graph state-space model, building exposure, physical vulnerability, weak supervision, probabilistic model, disaster resilience, risk audit | Code: https://github.com/riskaudit/GraphVSSM | Quezon City (Philippines) Dataset: https://doi.org/pzj2 | METEOR 2.5D Dataset, https://doi.org/pzq4, https://doi.org/pzrd | Khurushkul-Freetown Dataset: https://doi.org/pzkw</p></details> |
| **[Generalisation Bounds of Zero-Shot Economic Forecasting using Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15705v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09445v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

While significant progress has been made in algorithmic recourse for static data, such as tabular and image data, limited research explores recourse for multivariate time series, particularly for reversing abnormal time series. This paper introduces Recourse in time series Anomaly Detection (RecAD), a framework for addressing anomalies in multivariate time series using backtracking counterfactual reasoning. By modeling the causes of anomalies as external interventions on exogenous variables, RecAD predicts recourse actions to restore normal status as counterfactual explanations, where the recourse function, responsible for generating actions based on observed data, is trained using an end-to-end approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07360v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Sparse Principal Component Analysis of Multivariate Time Series in Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08177v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal component analysis has been a main tool in multivariate analysis for estimating a low dimensional linear subspace that explains most of the variability in the data. However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates of the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.</p></details> | 63 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00658v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | First draft |

However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance as a simple yet effective architecture.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource for the research community and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes.

This study introduces a ResE-BiLSTM model, using a sliding window technique, and is evaluated on 44 independent cohorts from the extensive Freddie Mac US mortgage dataset, to improve prediction performance. The ResE-BiLSTM is compared with five baseline models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), BiLSTM, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC. An ablation study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual components in the ResE-BiLSTM architecture. Additionally, SHAP analysis was employed to interpret the underlying features the model relied upon for its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that ResE-BiLSTM achieves superior predictive performance compared to baseline models, underscoring its practical value and applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting to the Unknown: Robust Meta-Learning for Zero-Shot Financial Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09664v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting in zero-shot settings is critical for investment decisions, especially during abrupt market regime shifts or in emerging markets with limited historical data. While Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approaches show promise, existing meta-task construction strategies often yield suboptimal performance for highly turbulent financial series. To address this, we propose a novel task-construction method that leverages learned embeddings for both meta task and also downstream predictions, enabling effective zero-shot meta-learning. Specifically, we use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to softly cluster embeddings, constructing two complementary meta-task types: intra-cluster tasks and inter-cluster tasks. By assigning embeddings to multiple latent regimes probabilistically, GMMs enable richer, more diverse meta-learning. This dual approach ensures the model can quickly adapt to local patterns while simultaneously capturing invariant cross-series features. Furthermore, we enhance inter-cluster generalization through hard task mining, which identifies robust patterns across divergent market regimes. Our method was validated using real-world financial data from high-volatility periods and multiple international markets (including emerging markets). The results demonstrate significant out-performance over existing approaches and stronger generalization in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Unique Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network without Markov Equivalence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10085v4)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying vanilla Bayesian network to model spatial-temporal causality can be a critical yet challenging task. Different Markovian-equivalent directed acyclic graphs would be identified if the identifiability is not satisfied. To address this issue, Directed Cyclic Graph is proposed to drop the directed acyclic constraint. But it does not always hold, and cannot model dynamical time-series process. Then, Full Time Graph is proposed with introducing high-order time delay. Full Time Graph has no Markov equivalence class by assuming no instantaneous effects. But, it also assumes that the causality is invariant with varying time, that is not always satisfied in the spatio-temporal scenarios. Thus, in this work, a Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network (STBN) is proposed to theoretically model the spatial-temporal causality from the perspective of information transfer. STBN explains the disappearance of network structure $X\rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and $X\leftarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ by the principle of information path blocking. And finally, the uniqueness of STBN is proved. Based on this, a High-order Causal Entropy (HCE) algorithm is also proposed to uniquely identify STBN under time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3\tau_{max})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum time delay. Numerical experiments are conducted with comparison to other baseline algorithms. The results show that HCE algorithm obtains state-of-the-art identification accuracy.

| **[Conditional independence testing with a single realization of a multivariate nonstationary nonlinear time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21647v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying relationships among stochastic processes is a core objective in many fields, such as economics. While the standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages, it can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector autoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods for causal discovery and variable selection for nonlinear time series, which routinely employ tests for conditional independence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional independence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary nonlinear process. We also show how our framework can be used to test for independence. The key technical ingredients of our framework are time-varying nonlinear regression, estimation of local long-run covariance matrices of products of error processes, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trends in Motion Prediction Toward Deployable and Generalizable Autonomy: A Revisit and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09074v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction, the anticipation of future agent states or scene evolution, is rooted in human cognition, bridging perception and decision-making. It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> |
| **[Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments. Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy, demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data. Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features. These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TriP-LLM: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00047v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[L-GTA: Latent Generative Modeling for Time Series Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23615v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applications of Medical AI (AMAI workshop) at MICCAI 2025 (submitted version)</p></details> |
| **[Overcoming error-in-variable problem in data-driven model discovery by orthogonal distance regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23426v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors). Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy, and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63, Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise contamination levels of up to 30%.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 12 figures, prepared for the Data-driven systems and control: analysis, modelling, optimisation, and stochasticity collection in the journal Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems</p></details> |

This is due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore, camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce- dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31 {\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 32nd International Conference on Neural Information Processing - ICONIP 2025</p></details> |

With the increasing adoption of distributed generation and emerging prosumer households, Energy Management Systems, which manage and apply flexibility of connected devices, are gaining popularity. While potentially beneficial to grid capacity, strategic energy management also adds to the complexity of distribution grid operation and planning processes. Novel approaches of time-series-based planning likewise face increasingly complex simulation scenarios and rising computational cost. Discrete event modelling helps facilitating simulations of such scenarios by restraining computation to the most relevant points in simulation time. We provide an enhancement of a discrete event distribution grid simulation software that offers fast implementation and testing of energy management algorithms, embedded into a feature-rich simulation environment. Physical models are specified using the Discrete Event System Specification. Furthermore, we contribute a communication protocol that makes use of the discrete event paradigm by only computing flexibility potential when necessary.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, part of PowerTech conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models can effectively forecast dynamical systems from time-series data, but they typically require large amounts of past data, making forecasting particularly challenging for systems with limited history. To overcome this, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting using Related Time Series (METAFORS), which generalizes knowledge across systems to enable forecasting in data-limited scenarios. By learning from a library of models trained on longer time series from potentially related systems, METAFORS builds and initializes a model tailored to short time-series data from the system of interest. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate that METAFORS can reliably predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics without requiring contextual labels. We see this even when test and related systems exhibit substantially different behaviors, highlighting METAFORS' strengths in data-limited scenarios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.</p></details> |  |

These systems often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability. Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in large-scale urban networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Foundation Models (FMs) can help improve forecasting of renewable generation and demand because FMs can rapidly process complex, high-dimensional time-series data. This review paper focuses on FMs in the realm of renewable energy forecasting, primarily focusing on wind and solar. We present an overview of the architectures, pretraining strategies, finetuning methods, and types of data used in the context of renewable energy forecasting. We emphasize the role of models that are trained at a large scale, domain specific Transformer architectures, where attention is paid to spatial temporal correlations, the embedding of domain knowledge, and also the brief and intermittent nature of renewable generation. We assess recent FM based advancements in forecast accuracy such as reconciling predictions over multiple time scales and quantifying uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting. We also review existing challenges and areas of improvement in long-term and multivariate time series forecasting. In this survey, a distinction between theory and practice is established regarding the use of FMs in the clean energy forecasting domain. Additionally, it critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of FMs while advancing future research direction in this new and exciting area of forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at the journal</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e. continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric, time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual behaviors impact overall process efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 5th Workshop on Change, Drift, and Dynamics of Organizational Processes (ProDy), BPM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deciphering interventional dynamical causality from non-intervention complex systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01621v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and quantifying causality is a focal topic in the fields of science, engineering, and interdisciplinary studies. However, causal studies on non-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely challenging. Delay-embedding technique provides a promising approach. In this study, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) in contrast to the traditional Constructive Dynamical Causality (ConDC). ConDC, including Granger causality, transfer entropy and convergence of cross-mapping, measures the causality by constructing a dynamical model without considering interventions. A computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), is proposed to measure causal strengths in an interventional manner. IEE is an intervened causal information flow but in the delay-embedding space. Further, the IEE theoretically and numerically enables the deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional) time-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real interventions in the considered system. In particular, IEE can be applied to rank causal effects according to their importance and construct causal networks from data. We conducted numerical experiments to demonstrate that IEE can find causal edges accurately, eliminate effects of confounding, and quantify causal strength robustly over traditional indices. We also applied IEE to real-world tasks. IEE performed as an accurate and robust tool for causal analyses solely from the observational data. The IntDC framework and IEE algorithm provide an efficient approach to the study of causality from time series in diverse non-intervention complex systems.</p></details> |  |

Numerous outages occur each year, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events. However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology, GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from 2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 24th International Semantic Web Conference Resource Track (ISWC 2025)</p></details> |

While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose ELF to answer this question. ELF is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. ELF consists of two parts: a) the ELF-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the ELF-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the ELF-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of ELF in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using ELF improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Their modeling is crucial for risk assessment and understanding the underlying dynamics. In this work, we introduce a local influence analysis to assess the stability of a class of extreme-value Birnbaum-Saunders regression models, which are particularly suited for analyzing such data. The proposed approach uses the conformal normal curvature (CNC) of the log-likelihood function to diagnose the influence of individual observations on the postulated model. By examining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the CNC, we identify influential data points-physical events that disproportionately affect the model's parameters. We illustrate the methodology through a simulation study and apply it to a time series of wind gust data from Itajai, Brazil, where a severe event caused multiple damages and casualties. Our approach successfully pinpoints this specific event as a highly influential observation and quantifies its impact on the fitted model. This work provides a valuable diagnostic tool for physicists and data scientists working with extreme-value models of complex natural phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 6 Figures.

| **[Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409v4)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle: not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 11 figures.

Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems for Agriculture with Featural-Temporal Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22962v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However, traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods, frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area. The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print v0.8 2025-07-30</p></details> |

In this work, we propose an \emph{Adaptive State-Space Mamba} (\textbf{ASSM}) framework for real-time sensor data anomaly detection. While state-space models have been previously employed for image processing applications (e.g., style transfer \cite{wang2024stylemamba}), our approach leverages the core idea of sequential hidden states to tackle a significantly different domain: detecting anomalies on streaming sensor data. In particular, we introduce an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically modulates the hidden state update based on contextual and learned statistical cues. This design ensures that our model remains computationally efficient and scalable, even under rapid data arrival rates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic sensor datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance compared to existing baselines. Our approach is easily extensible to other time-series tasks that demand rapid and reliable detection capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> |

While asymptotic error bounds have been established for specific ARMA models on $L^2[0,1]$, a general theoretical framework has not yet been considered. This paper fills in this gap by deriving consistent estimators for the operators characterizing the invertible representation of a functional time series with white noise innovations in a general separable Hilbert space. Under mild conditions covering a broad class of functional time series, we establish explicit asymptotic error bounds, with rates determined by operator smoothness and eigenvalue decay. These results further provide consistency-rate estimates for operators in Hilbert space-valued causal linear processes, including functional MA, AR, and ARMA models of arbitrary order.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Measuring Time-Series Dataset Similarity using Wasserstein Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22189v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution (MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation, with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss (>0.60).</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Demand Forecasting via Dual-Strategy Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22053v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.</p></details> |  |

However, satellite time series are voluminous, often corrupted by sensor noise, clouds, and atmospheric conditions, and unevenly spaced in time, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, openness, computation-, label-, and data-efficiency, and high performance will prove transformative in a wide range of vegetation-oriented ecological and agricultural applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field.

Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task, limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover, they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains, hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction, and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives. Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a fully unsupervised manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Probabilistic Modeling with LLM for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10774v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples.

| **[Motion Diffusion Autoencoders: Enabling Attribute Manipulation in Human Motion Demonstrated on Karate Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18729v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute manipulation deals with the problem of changing individual attributes of a data point or a time series, while leaving all other aspects unaffected. This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. All code and data is made publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability, PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.</p></details> |  |

This trend has also permeated the field of time series analysis, especially for long-horizon forecasting, showcasing promising results both in performance and running time. In this paper, we introduce Local Attention Mechanism (LAM), an efficient attention mechanism tailored for time series analysis. This mechanism exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed. We present an algorithm for implementing LAM in tensor algebra that runs in time and memory O(nlogn), significantly improving upon the O(n^2) time and memory complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. We also note the lack of proper datasets to evaluate long-horizon forecast models. Thus, we propose a novel set of datasets to improve the evaluation of models addressing long-horizon forecasting challenges. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the vanilla transformer architecture magnified with LAM surpasses state-of-the-art models, including the vanilla attention mechanism. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and highlight a range of future challenges in long-sequence time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

To address this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding, fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex feature engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments:12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; accepted to the 26th World Conference on Information Security Applications (WISA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Stochastic Differential Equation Models for Latent Manifold Learning in Neural Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21531v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models, recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.</p></details> |  |

| **[User Trajectory Prediction Unifying Global and Local Temporal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02161v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN), and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions, enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally, CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction, while maintaining similar inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/segmentdreamer/</p></details> |

To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[H2C: Hippocampal Circuit-inspired Continual Learning for Lifelong Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01158v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD). However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts. The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open ...</summary><p>Open source code: https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong</p></details> |
| **[Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12327v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rampdown phase of a tokamak pulse is difficult to simulate and often exacerbates multiple plasma instabilities. To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations.

| **[Radio Map-Enabled 3D Trajectory and Communication Optimization for Low-Altitude Air-Ground Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06944v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-altitude economy includes the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving ground robots. This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories. Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, to be published in IEEE Conference on Games 2025</p></details> |
| **[TrajSurv: Learning Continuous Latent Trajectories from Electronic Health Records for Trustworthy Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00657v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MLHC 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

By embedding structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations, historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of trajectory samples.

However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniTraj: Pre-Training on Heterogeneous Data for Adaptive and Zero-Shot Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23657v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution. Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA, WorldPose, and ETH-UCY.

| **[PatchTraj: Unified Time-Frequency Representation Learning via Dynamic Patches for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19119v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging via Diffusion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23411v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently, and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Uncertainty for Safe Utilization of Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Trajectories: Foundations and Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23280v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work establishes a crucial step toward advancing data-driven trajectory-based methods for stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics. In contrast to scenario-based approaches that rely on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trajectories, this work develops a data-driven framework where each trajectory is gathered over a finite horizon and exhibits temporal dependence-referred to as a non-i.i.d. trajectory. To ensure safety of dynamical systems using such trajectories, the current body of literature primarily considers dynamics subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances, which facilitates robust analysis. While promising, such bounds may be violated in practice and the resulting worst-case robust analysis tends to be overly conservative. To overcome these fundamental challenges, this paper considers stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics, influenced by process noise with unknown distributions. In the proposed framework, data is collected from stochastic systems under multiple realizations within a finite-horizon experiment, where each realization generates a non-i.i.d. trajectory. Leveraging the concept of stochastic control barrier certificates constructed from data, this work quantifies probabilistic safety guarantees with a certified confidence level. To achieve this, the proposed conditions are formulated as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems, relying solely on empirical average of the collected trajectories and statistical features of the process noise. The efficacy of the approach has been validated on three stochastic benchmarks with both unknown models and noise distributions. In one case study, it is shown that while no safety controller exists for the robust analysis of the system under bounded disturbances, the proposed stochastic framework offers a safety controller with guaranteed probabilistic satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into the Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |

Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

| **[Safety Evaluation of Motion Plans Using Trajectory Predictors as Forward Reachable Set Estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22389v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions, conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness, offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively.

Despite initial progress, these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks. These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database. Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning. Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[RISEE: A Highly Interactive Naturalistic Driving Trajectories Dataset with Human Subjective Risk Perception and Eye-tracking Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19490v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V) phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV) videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited participants.

| **[How Growing Toxicity Manifests: A Topic Trajectory Analysis of U.S. Immigration Discourse on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21418v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online public sphere, discussions about immigration often become increasingly fractious, marked by toxic language and polarization. Drawing on 4 million X posts over six months, we combine a user- and topic-centric approach to study how shifts in toxicity manifest as topical shifts. Our topic discovery method, which leverages instruction-based embeddings and recursive HDBSCAN, uncovers 157 fine-grained subtopics within the U.S. immigration discourse. We focus on users in four groups: (1) those with increasing toxicity, (2) those with decreasing toxicity, and two reference groups with no significant toxicity trend but matched toxicity levels. Treating each posting history as a trajectory through a five-dimensional topic space, we compare average group trajectories using permutational MANOVA. Our findings show that users with increasing toxicity drift toward alarmist, fear-based frames, whereas those with decreasing toxicity pivot toward legal and policy-focused themes. Both patterns diverge statistically significantly from their reference groups. This pipeline, which combines hierarchical topic discovery with trajectory analysis, offers a replicable method for studying dynamic conversations around social issues at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint of a paper accepted at ICWSM 2026</p></details> |
| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v4)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

Current approaches rely on flat apertures, which limit trajectory flexibility due to inherent geometric constraints. To overcome such restrictions, we propose adopting curved apertures as a more versatile alternative for beam shaping. We introduce a novel formulation for wave trajectory engineering compatible with arbitrarily shaped apertures. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that curved apertures offer improved control over wave propagation, are more resilient to phase control constraints, and achieve higher power density across a wider portion of the desired beam trajectory than flat apertures.</p></details> |  |

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as K.

| **[FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23145v4)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Expert Factors: Trajectory-level Reward Shaping for Formulaic Alpha Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20263v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First and Second authors contributed equally; Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation; Winner of the best paper award</p></details> |
| **[MIAT: Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05059v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for safe and efficient autonomous driving, especially in mixed traffic environments when both human-driven and autonomous vehicles co-exist. However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/cpraskoti/MIAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025.

Current SotA-models already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2, NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas. Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better generalization to unseen scenarios.

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context.

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |

Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and SI</p></details> |

Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v4)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.</p></details> | 8 papers,7 figures |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and show high performance with thousands of segments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

| **[InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12174v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foresight in Motion: Reinforcing Trajectory Prediction with Reward Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12083v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient. Our code, pretrained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/sony/sbctm/.</p></details> |  |

This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML/PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.</p></details> |  |

While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Linear Parametric Map Modeling and Perception-aware Trajectory Planning for Mobile Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09340v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) in July 2025</p></details> |

While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Entity Representation Learning Through Onsite-Offsite Graph for Pinterset Ads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02609v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage}, TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Structure Sharing Empowers Multi-task Heterogeneous GNNs for Customer Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22089v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer expansion, i.e., growing a business existing customer base by acquiring new customers, is critical for scaling operations and sustaining the long-term profitability of logistics companies. Although state-of-the-art works model this task as a single-node classification problem under a heterogeneous graph learning framework and achieve good performance, they struggle with extremely positive label sparsity issues in our scenario. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers a promising solution by introducing a correlated, label-rich task to enhance the label-sparse task prediction through knowledge sharing. However, existing MTL methods result in performance degradation because they fail to discriminate task-shared and task-specific structural patterns across tasks. This issue arises from their limited consideration of the inherently complex structure learning process of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which involves the multi-layer aggregation of multi-type relations. To address the challenge, we propose a Structure-Aware Hierarchical Information Sharing Framework (SrucHIS), which explicitly regulates structural information sharing across tasks in logistics customer expansion. SrucHIS breaks down the structure learning phase into multiple stages and introduces sharing mechanisms at each stage, effectively mitigating the influence of task-specific structural patterns during each stage. We evaluate StrucHIS on both private and public datasets, achieving a 51.41% average precision improvement on the private dataset and a 10.52% macro F1 gain on the public dataset. StrucHIS is further deployed at one of the largest logistics companies in China and demonstrates a 41.67% improvement in the success contract-signing rate over existing strategies, generating over 453K new orders within just two months.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Effectiveness of Graph Neural Network Architectures for Network Digital Twins (NDTs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02373v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of interconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements. While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated, GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the next-generation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Skeleton-Guided Learning for Shortest Path Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02270v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage. Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for learning-based shortest path search.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedGNN: Capturing the Links Between Urban Characteristics and Medical Prescriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04739v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban socio-demographic and environmental factors relate with health is essential for public health and urban planning. However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19093v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Embedding with Completely-imbalanced Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03545v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network embedding, aiming to project a network into a low-dimensional space, is increasingly becoming a focus of network research. Semi-supervised network embedding takes advantage of labeled data, and has shown promising performance. However, existing semi-supervised methods would get unappealing results in the completely-imbalanced label setting where some classes have no labeled nodes at all. To alleviate this, we propose two novel semi-supervised network embedding methods. The first one is a shallow method named RSDNE. Specifically, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RSDNE guarantees both intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity in an approximate way. The other method is RECT which is a new class of graph neural networks. Different from RSDNE, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RECT explores the class-semantic knowledge. This enables RECT to handle networks with node features and multi-label setting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/RECT.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this work was accepted in AAAI 2018.

| **[Flow-Aware GNN for Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Substation Breaker Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01951v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Binary to Continuous: Stochastic Re-Weighting for Robust Graph Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01925v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be flexibly integrated with different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path-LLM: A Shortest-Path-based LLM Learning for Unified Graph Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05456v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified graph representation learning aims to generate node embeddings, which can be applied to multiple downstream applications of graph analytics. However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needs toward specific downstream predictions, poor generalization, or shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to efficiently learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of four well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which can cover key connections between different dense groups. An in-depth analysis and comparison of different path selections is conducted to justify the rationale behind our designed L2SP method. Next, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts with key phrase selection from node text attributes. We then feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to align next node/edge generation in L2SP with next token generation in causal language modeling for graph representation learning and finally extract the unified graph embeddings. We theoretically analyze the algorithm complexity of our Path-LLM approach. Extensive experiments on large-scale graph benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against state-of-the-art methods WalkLM, GraphGPT, OFA, and GraphTranslator on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and edge validation) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search). Compared with WalkLM, our approach saves more than 90% of training paths on millions-scale graphs and runs at most 35x faster.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Learning for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01557v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path. Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on unseen synthetic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Inversion Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19440v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from the gradient exchange of neural networks during federated learning. However, the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attacks, i.e., reconstructing both node features and graph structure from gradients, remains largely underexplored. To answer this question, this paper studies the problem of whether private data can be reconstructed from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG). Two widely used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on reconstruction are extensively discussed. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that, by leveraging the unique properties of graph data and GNNs, GLG achieves more accurate reconstruction of both nodal features and graph structure from gradients.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=a0mLrqkWyx</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v4)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[A graph neural network based on feature network for identifying influential nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01278v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency, FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework, two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization design in communicating uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures, paper accepted to IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |

In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation (Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention. Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[BSL: A Unified and Generalizable Multitask Learning Platform for Virtual Drug Discovery from Design to Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01195v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.</p></details> |  |
| **[FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02082v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into SMILES, enriching SMILES with detailed chemical context. For example, instead of using "O" to represent all oxygen atoms, we use specific tokens like "O_ketone" and "O_hydroxyl" to differentiate oxygen atoms belonging to distinct functional groups. This tokenization expands the chemical lexicon, effectively bridging the gap between SMILES and natural language in terms of vocabulary size, ultimately enhancing the model's ability to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by (1) using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and (2) employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. FARM leverages contrastive learning to aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 out of 13 tasks.

In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025. v3: Corrected typo in references</p></details> |
| **[Explaining GNN Explanations with Edge Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01048v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Node Duplication Improves Cold-start Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09711v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are prominent in graph machine learning and have shown state-of-the-art performance in Link Prediction (LP) tasks. Nonetheless, recent studies show that GNNs struggle to produce good results on low-degree nodes despite their overall strong performance. In practical applications of LP, like recommendation systems, improving performance on low-degree nodes is critical, as it amounts to tackling the cold-start problem of improving the experiences of users with few observed interactions. In this paper, we investigate improving GNNs' LP performance on low-degree nodes while preserving their performance on high-degree nodes and propose a simple yet surprisingly effective augmentation technique called NodeDup. Specifically, NodeDup duplicates low-degree nodes and creates links between nodes and their own duplicates before following the standard supervised LP training scheme. By leveraging a ''multi-view'' perspective for low-degree nodes, NodeDup shows significant LP performance improvements on low-degree nodes without compromising any performance on high-degree nodes. Additionally, as a plug-and-play augmentation module, NodeDup can be easily applied to existing GNNs with very light computational cost. Extensive experiments show that NodeDup achieves 38.49%, 13.34%, and 6.76% improvements on isolated, low-degree, and warm nodes, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to GNNs and state-of-the-art cold-start methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the competitive performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs, which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks. Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large, unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex network problems.</p></details> |  |

While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

| **[Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model for Predicting Patient Criticalness Using Graph Neural Networks and EHR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00615v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However, conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure (combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$) outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also demonstrate improved precision/recall and show that the attention mechanism provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00578v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, and 4 tables (references and SI included)</p></details> |
| **[Court of LLMs: Evidence-Augmented Generation via Multi-LLM Collaboration for Text-Attributed Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00507v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual information in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for graph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while preserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37% in AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (MM '25)</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00506v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video supplement demonstrating feature-space exploration and interactive labelling is available at: https://youtu.be/GZl1ebZJgEA and is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16676591</p></details> |
| **[ReaGAN: Node-as-Agent-Reasoning Graph Agentic Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00429v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Branch Specialization in Spectral-Spatial Graph Neural Networks for Certified Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08320v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine spectral-spatial architectures for enhanced representation learning. However, limited attention has been paid to certified robustness, particularly regarding training strategies and underlying rationale. In this paper, we explicitly specialize each branch: the spectral network is trained to withstand l0 edge flips and capture homophilic structures, while the spatial part is designed to resist linf feature perturbations and heterophilic patterns. A context-aware gating network adaptively fuses the two representations, dynamically routing each node's prediction to the more reliable branch. This specialized adversarial training scheme uses branch-specific inner maximization (structure vs feature attacks) and a unified alignment objective. We provide theoretical guarantees: (i) expressivity of the gating mechanism beyond 1-WL, (ii) spectral-spatial frequency bias, and (iii) certified robustness with trade-off. Empirically, SpecSphere attains state-of-the-art node classification accuracy and offers tighter certified robustness on real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sheaf Graph Neural Networks via PAC-Bayes Spectral Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00357v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling Size Generalization of Graph Neural Networks on Biological Data from a Spectral Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15611v5)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the key challenge of size-induced distribution shifts in graph neural networks (GNNs) and their impact on the generalization of GNNs to larger graphs. Existing literature operates under diverse assumptions about distribution shifts, resulting in varying conclusions about the generalizability of GNNs. In contrast to prior work, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify and characterize the types of size-induced distribution shifts and explore their impact on GNN performance from a spectral standpoint, a perspective that has been largely underexplored. Leveraging the significant variance in graph sizes in real biological datasets, we analyze biological graphs and find that spectral differences, driven by subgraph patterns (e.g., average cycle length), strongly correlate with GNN performance on larger, unseen graphs. Based on these insights, we propose three model-agnostic strategies to enhance GNNs' awareness of critical subgraph patterns, identifying size-intensive attention as the most effective approach. Extensive experiments with six GNN architectures and seven model-agnostic strategies across five datasets show that our size-intensive attention strategy significantly improves graph classification on test graphs 2 to 10 times larger than the training graphs, boosting F1 scores by up to 8% over strong baselines.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Geometric Multi-color Message Passing Graph Neural Networks for Blood-brain Barrier Permeability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18926v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Due to the recursive neighborhood aggregations employed by GCNs, efficient training methods suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees or are missing important practical elements from modern deep learning algorithms, such as adaptivity and momentum. In this paper, we present several neighbor-sampling (NS) based Adam-type stochastic methods for solving a nonconvex GCN training problem. We utilize the control variate technique proposed by [1] to reduce the stochastic error caused by neighbor sampling. Under standard assumptions for Adam-type methods, we show that our methods enjoy the optimal convergence rate. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical experiments on node classification tasks with several benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate superior performance of our methods over classic NS-based SGD that also uses the control-variate technique, especially for large-scale graph datasets.

However, most existing solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions, is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and 39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.</p></details> |  |

However, many cities face significant challenges of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network, comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments (99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and maximize volume estimation accuracy and reliability of bicycling data for informed transportation planning decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20980v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.</p></details> |  |

These systems often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability. Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in large-scale urban networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing research still struggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple vehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal learning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal features that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These features are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By using causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization of vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during training and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based methods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative reward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing multi-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation safer and more efficient in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |

We prove that recurrent GNNs with finite-precision parameters, sum aggregation, and ReLU activation, can compute any graph algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the Color Refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI 2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually match this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where each graph size requires a different GNN to compute with. Our construction introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space. Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, for connected graphs recurrent GNNs can express all graph algorithms. In particular, any polynomial-time graph algorithm can be emulated on connected graphs in polynomial time by a recurrent GNN with random initialization.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hyperbolic Graph Learning: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13852v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning in Euclidean space, despite its widespread adoption and proven utility in many domains, often struggles to effectively capture the inherent hierarchical and complex relational structures prevalent in real-world data, particularly for datasets exhibiting a highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy or power-law distributions. Hyperbolic geometry, with its constant negative curvature and exponential growth property, naturally accommodates such structures, offering a promising alternative for learning rich graph representations. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving field of Hyperbolic Graph Learning (HGL). We systematically categorize and analyze existing methods broadly dividing them into (1) hyperbolic graph embedding-based techniques, (2) graph neural network-based hyperbolic models, and (3) emerging paradigms. Beyond methodologies, we extensively discuss diverse applications of HGL across multiple domains, including recommender systems, knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, and other relevant scenarios, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of hyperbolic geometry in real-world graph learning tasks. Most importantly, we identify several key challenges that serve as directions for advancing HGL, including handling complex data structures, developing geometry-aware learning objectives, ensuring trustworthy and scalable implementations, and integrating with foundation models, e.g., large language models. We highlight promising research opportunities in this exciting interdisciplinary area.

However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes at https://github.com/IRMVLab/TopoLiDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025.

| **[Masked Language Models are Good Heterogeneous Graph Generalizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06157v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with LLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach typically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm. Specifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Android Malware Detection: Traditional vs. Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15041v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android malware detection has been extensively studied using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. While many state-of-the-art detection models, particularly those based on DL, claim superior performance, they often rely on limited comparisons, lacking comprehensive benchmarking against traditional ML models across diverse datasets. This raises concerns about the robustness of DL-based approaches' performance and the potential oversight of simpler, more efficient ML models. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Android malware detection models across four datasets: three recently published, publicly available datasets and a large-scale dataset we systematically collected. We implement a range of traditional ML models, including Random Forests (RF) and CatBoost, alongside advanced DL models such as Capsule Graph Neural Networks (CapsGNN), BERT-based models, and ExcelFormer based models. Our results reveal that in many cases simpler and more computationally efficient ML models achieve comparable or even superior performance compared with DL models. These findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking in Android malware detection research. We encourage future studies to conduct more comprehensive benchmarking comparisons between traditional and advanced models to ensure a more accurate assessment of detection capabilities. To facilitate further research, we provide access to our dataset, including app IDs, hash values, and labels.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Data-Driven Extended Corresponding State Approach for Residual Property Prediction of Hydrofluoroolefins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21720v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state, the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Torque-based Graph Surgery:Enhancing Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Rewiring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Generation of Diverse Courses of Actions for Multi-Agent Operations using Binary Optimization and Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20031v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> |

However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap, this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities. Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77 community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns. Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning in the complex spatial choice contexts.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |

Current methods using dense point clouds for accurate place recognition do not scale well due to computationally expensive scan-to-scan comparisons. Alternative object-centric approaches are more efficient but often struggle with sensitivity to viewpoint variation. In this work, we introduce REGRACE, a novel approach that addresses these challenges of scalability and perspective difference in re-localization by using LiDAR-based submaps. We introduce rotation-invariant features for each labeled object and enhance them with neighborhood context through a graph neural network. To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap. Additionally, we define a revisit with geometrical consistency cues rather than embedding distance, allowing us to recognize far-away loop closures. Our evaluations demonstrate that REGRACE achieves similar results compared to state-of-the-art place recognition and registration baselines while being twice as fast. Code and models are publicly available.</p></details> | Accepted to IROS2025 |

To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation, graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources.

Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings, validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.</p></details> |  |

GNN explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers, Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and efficiency in GNN inference.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To fulfill this need, we introduce BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end network-based multi-omics data analysis.

Traditional methods often struggle with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training. This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning, with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across various fields.</p></details> |  |

It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse subpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the biological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell interactions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and histological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of pairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial transcriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they are grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for capturing implicit connections among the cells. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having the actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of 1.843 compared to other methods. This score indicates the greatest diversity of cell types identified by our method. Furthermore, our model outperforms other methods in downstream clustering, achieving the highest ARI values of 0.51 and Leiden score of 0.60.</p></details> |  |

Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph, making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20147v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) is mainly based on anonymous user interaction sequences to recommend the items that the next user is most likely to click. Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily leverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as graph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most GNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information of session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded within them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to accurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The method utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate item sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer multi-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an alignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by the LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments conducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity, especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graded Transformers: A Symbolic-Geometric Approach to Structured Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20108v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT, exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data. We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work. The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Owns This Sample: Cross-Client Membership Inference Attack in Federated Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19964v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups. Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |

These representations are typically assumed to capture rule-like inference patterns. However, our theoretical understanding of which inference patterns can be captured remains limited. Ideally, KG embedding methods should be expressive enough such that for any set of rules, there exist relation embeddings that exactly capture these rules. This principle has been studied within the framework of region-based embeddings, but existing models are severely limited in the kinds of rule bases that can be captured. We argue that this stems from the fact that entity embeddings are only compared in a coordinate-wise fashion. As an alternative, we propose RESHUFFLE, a simple model based on ordering constraints that can faithfully capture a much larger class of rule bases than existing approaches. Most notably, RESHUFFLE can capture bounded inference w.r.t. arbitrary sets of closed path rules. The entity embeddings in our framework can be learned by a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which effectively acts as a differentiable rule base.</p></details> | Accepted for KR 2025 |

However, predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Physics and Topology in Neural Networks for Learning Rigid Body Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11467v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid body interactions are fundamental to numerous scientific disciplines, but remain challenging to simulate due to their abrupt nonlinear nature and sensitivity to complex, often unknown environmental factors. These challenges call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes, offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios. Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12949v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025 (WWW2025)</p></details> |

Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve. These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20719v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The camera ready version for ECAI-2025</p></details> |

Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Transverse Momentum Estimation in CMS Trigger Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19205v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs) often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables: station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity ($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines. Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with $\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet, while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean flow data assimilation using physics-constrained Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns. However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

These methods bridge the gap between the expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for deployment in diverse application settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThermoRL:Structure-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Protein Mutation Design to Enhance Thermostability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18816v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing mutations to optimize protein thermostability remains challenging due to the complex relationship between sequence variations, structural dynamics, and thermostability, often assessed by \delta\delta G (the change in free energy of unfolding). Existing methods rely on experimental random mutagenesis or prediction models tested with pre-defined datasets, using sequence-based heuristics and treating enzyme design as a one-step process without iterative refinement, which limits design space exploration and restricts discoveries beyond known variations. We present ThermoRL, a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages graph neural networks (GNN) to design mutations with enhanced thermostability. It combines a pre-trained GNN-based encoder with a hierarchical Q-learning network and employs a surrogate model for reward feedback, guiding the RL agent on where (the position) and which (mutant amino acid) to apply for enhanced thermostability. Experimental results show that ThermoRL achieves higher or comparable rewards than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. It filters out destabilizing mutations and identifies stabilizing mutations aligned with experimental data. Moreover, ThermoRL accurately detects key mutation sites in unseen proteins, highlighting its strong generalizability. This RL-guided approach powered by GNN embeddings offers a robust alternative to traditional protein mutation design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ralts: Robust Aggregation for Enhancing Graph Neural Network Resilience on Bit-flip Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18804v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors. Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of $3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Indirect Calls in Binary Code via Cross-Reference Augmented Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18801v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code analysis is essential in scenarios where source code is unavailable, with extensive applications across various security domains. However, accurately resolving indirect call targets remains a longstanding challenge in maintaining the integrity of static analysis in binary code. This difficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax) remains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural control flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy and limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this ML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee training pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which undermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce NeuCall, a novel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks. Existing ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and code cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's control flow. In contrast, NeuCall augments CFGs with cross-references, preserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced compiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training pairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph neural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions for accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from GitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, NeuCall achieves an F1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches. These results highlight NeuCall's effectiveness in building precise inter-procedural CFGs and its potential to advance downstream binary analysis and security applications.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comparison of stretched-grid and limited-area modelling for data-driven regional weather forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18378v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy, outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs. In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM) approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts, based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences in model design impact relative performance and potential applications. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain. Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting system.</p></details> |  |
