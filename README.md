| **[Analysis and Simulation of a Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer in Contact With a Solid Bulk Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02150v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reformulation of UVN-Flash for Multicomponent Two-Phase Systems with Application to CO2-rich Mixture Transport in Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20965v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pipeline transport of dense-phase CO2-rich mixtures is a crucial component in carbon capture and storage (CCS). Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures, 4 appendicies</p></details> |
| **[A Fourier/Modal-Spectral-Element Method for the Simulation of High-Reynolds Number Incompressible Stratified Flows in Domains with a Single Non-Periodic Direction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20833v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the components of a high-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver designed to simulate high-Reynolds-number stratified flows. The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.</p></details> | 41 pages, 24 figures |
| **[MDBench: Benchmarking Data-Driven Methods for Model Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20529v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[xGFabric: Coupling Sensor Networks and HPC Facilities with Private 5G Wireless Networks for Real-Time Digital Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20340v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced scientific applications require coupling distributed sensor networks with centralized high-performance computing facilities. Citrus Under Protective Screening (CUPS) exemplifies this need in digital agriculture, where citrus research facilities are instrumented with numerous sensors monitoring environmental conditions and detecting protective screening damage. CUPS demands access to computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling environmental conditions and guiding real-time interventions like water application or robotic repairs. These computing domains have contrasting properties: sensor networks provide low-performance, limited-capacity, unreliable data access, while high-performance facilities offer enormous computing power through high-latency batch processing. Private 5G networks present novel capabilities addressing this challenge by providing low latency, high throughput, and reliability necessary for near-real-time coupling of edge sensor networks with HPC simulations. This work presents xGFabric, an end-to-end system coupling sensor networks with HPC facilities through Private 5G networks. The prototype connects remote sensors via 5G network slicing to HPC systems, enabling real-time digital agriculture simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with 7 figures followed by 3 pages of reproducibility appendix.

| **[Model-Agnostic AI Framework with Explicit Time Integration for Long-Term Fluid Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05657v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GradNetOT: Learning Optimal Transport Maps with GradNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13191v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, which arises in modern applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees that the unique optimal transport map satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation and is the gradient of a convex function. In [arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps across both image morphing tasks and high-dimensional OT problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAMSA...</summary><p>CAMSAP 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[A Divergence-free Preserving Mixed Finite Element Method for Thermally Driven Active Fluid Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19053v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we propose a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element method (FEM) for the system of nonlinear fourth-order thermally driven active fluid equations. By introducing two auxiliary variables, we lower the complexity of the model and enhance the robustness of the algorithm. The auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$ is used to convert the original fourth-order system to an equivalent system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-conforming finite element space. The second variable $\eta$, analogous to the pressure, helps the scheme preserve the divergence-free condition arising from the model. The two-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator, unconditionally non-linear stable and second-order accurate under non-uniform time grids, is combined with the mixed FEM for fully discrete approximation. Due to the fine properties of the DLN scheme, we prove the boundedness of model energy and the associated error estimates under suitable regularity assumptions and mild time restrictions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a minimum-dissipation criterion is to balance computational costs and time efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi Steady-State Frequency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21461v5)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition. Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVADNet3D: A Deep Autoencoder for Reconstructing 3D Intraventricular Flow from Sparse Hemodynamic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16860v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of intraventricular blood flow is essential for evaluating hemodynamic conditions in patients supported by Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs). However, clinical imaging is either incompatible with LVADs or yields sparse, low-quality velocity data. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide high-fidelity data, they are computationally intensive and impractical for routine clinical use. To address this, we propose LVADNet3D, a 3D convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs full-resolution intraventricular velocity fields from sparse velocity vector inputs. In contrast to a standard UNet3D model, LVADNet3D incorporates hybrid downsampling and a deeper encoder-decoder architecture with increased channel capacity to better capture spatial flow patterns. To train and evaluate the models, we generate a high-resolution synthetic dataset of intraventricular blood flow in LVAD-supported hearts using CFD simulations. We also investigate the effect of conditioning the models on anatomical and physiological priors. Across various input configurations, LVADNet3D outperforms the baseline UNet3D model, yielding lower reconstruction error and higher PSNR results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 6 pages, 4 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[CFD-LLMBench: A Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Large Language Models in Computational Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20374v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems.

| **[Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method with Upper and Lower Bound Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16018v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) is a simple and effective method for reconstructing a function from its incomplete pointwise observations. However, applying DEIM to functions with physically constrained ranges can produce reconstructions with values outside the prescribed physical bounds. Such physically constrained quantities occur routinely in applications, e.g., mass density whose range is nonnegative. The DEIM reconstructions which violate these physical constraints are not usable in downstream tasks such as forecasting and control. To address this issue, we develop Constrained DEIM (C-DEIM) whose reconstructions are guaranteed to respect the physical bounds of the quantity of interest. C-DEIM enforces the bounds as soft constraints, in the form of a carefully designed penalty term, added to the underlying least squares problem. We prove that the C-DEIM reconstructions satisfy the physical constraints asymptotically, i.e., as the penalty parameter increases towards infinity. We also derive a quantitative upper bound for the observation residual of C-DEIM. Based on these theoretical results, we devise an efficient algorithm for practical implementation of C-DEIM. The efficacy of the method and the accompanying algorithm are demonstrated on several examples, including a heat transfer problem from fluid dynamics and a cellular automaton model of wildfire spread.</p></details> |  |

The library is designed to be extendable and productive, leveraging an expressive high-level API built on the Gridap PDE solver backend, while achieving high performance through Julia's just-in-time compiler and advanced lazy evaluation techniques. GridapROMs is PDE-agnostic, enabling its application to a wide range of problems, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady, and unsteady equations. This work details the library's key innovations, implementation principles, and core components, providing usage examples and demonstrating its capabilities by solving a fluid dynamics problem modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a 3D geometry.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Foam-Agent: An End-to-End Composable Multi-Agent Framework for Automating CFD Simulation in OpenFOAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18178v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing.

| **[Performance measurements of modern Fortran MPI applications with Score-P](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16592v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Version 3.0 of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard, released in 2012, introduced a new set of language bindings for Fortran 2008. By making use of modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was finally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran. This highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely adopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support for the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to recede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08 bindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by implementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard version 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By implementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for MPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The implementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08 wrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a spectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this work, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the implementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key component of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately 50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python pympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from the MPI standard.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order derivative-informed neural operator for subsurface fluid-flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13620v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing and benchmarking emerging supercomputers via the MFC flow solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13575v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying new supercomputers requires testing and evaluation via application codes. Portable, user-friendly tools enable evaluation, and the Multicomponent Flow Code (MFC), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, addresses this need. MFC is adorned with a toolchain that automates input generation, compilation, batch job submission, regression testing, and benchmarking. The toolchain design enables users to evaluate compiler-hardware combinations for correctness and performance with limited software engineering experience. As with other PDE solvers, wall time per spatially discretized grid point serves as a figure of merit. We present MFC benchmarking results for five generations of NVIDIA GPUs, three generations of AMD GPUs, and various CPU architectures, utilizing Intel, Cray, NVIDIA, AMD, and GNU compilers. These tests have revealed compiler bugs and regressions on recent machines such as Frontier and El Capitan. MFC has benchmarked approximately 50 compute devices and 5 flagship supercomputers.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Curriculum Learning for Mesh-based simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13138v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Control with Reference Learning for Soft Robotic Intracranial Pressure Waveform Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13109v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a learning-based control framework for a soft robotic actuator system designed to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms, which is essential for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and pathological processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints. Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and 73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean and amplitude.</p></details> |  |

Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning. A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation. The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times. This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.</p></details> |  |
| **[IGA-LBM: Isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11427v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lattice Boltzmann method has become a widely adopted approach in computational fluid dynamics, offering unique advantages in mesoscopic kinetic modeling, intrinsic parallelism, and simple treatment of boundary conditions. However, its conventional reliance on Cartesian grids fundamentally limits geometric fidelity in flows involving curved boundaries, introducing stair-step artifacts that propagate as spurious forces and boundary-layer inaccuracies. To address these challenges, we propose the isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method, which seamlessly integrates Isogeometric Analysis with LBM, leveraging the geometric precision of non-uniform rational B-Splines to construct body-fitted computational grids. Unlike conventional Cartesian-based LBM, the proposed approach eliminates stair-step boundary artifacts by providing sub-element geometric accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of LBM. Furthermore, the higher-order continuity of NURBS improves gradient resolution, reducing numerical diffusion in high-Reynold's-number flows. The parametric grid adaptation of IGA enables $h$-, $p$-, and $k$-refinement strategies, allowing for localized resolution enhancement in boundary layers and regions with high solution gradients. Additionally, the diffeomorphic mapping properties of IGA ensure intrinsic conservation, preserving advection invariants and suppressing numerical oscillations, leading to enhanced stability. Benchmark simulations on flows with curved and complex geometries demonstrate that IGA-LBM delivers significantly more accurate boundary-layer predictions and pressure/force estimates than standard Cartesian LBM, while preserving its computational efficiency and scalability. By combining geometric exactness with the algorithmic simplicity of LBM, IGA-LBM offers a practical route to high-fidelity simulations in engineering and scientific applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at [https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke](https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke).</p></details> |  |

For subject-specific analyses, the anatomy and blood flow of the subject can be captured non-invasively using structural and 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on the other hand, can be used to generate blood flow simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. To generate and analyze subject-specific blood flow simulations, MRI and CFD have to be brought together. Methods: We present an interactive, customizable, and user-oriented visual analysis tool that assists researchers in both medicine and numerical analysis. Our open-source tool is applicable to domains such as CFD and MRI, and it facilitates the analysis of simulation results and medical data, especially in hemodynamic studies. It enables the creation of simulation ensembles with a high variety of parameters. Furthermore, it allows for the visual and analytical examination of simulations and measurements through 2D embeddings of the similarity space. Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we applied it to three real-world use cases, showcasing its ability to configure simulation ensembles and analyse blood flow dynamics. We evaluated our example cases together with MRI and CFD experts to further enhance features and increase the usability. Conclusions: By combining the strengths of both CFD and MRI, our tool provides a more comprehensive understanding of hemodynamic parameters, facilitating more accurate analysis of hemodynamic biomarkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with deformable interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |

While they excel at many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics, remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over 400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities and limitations.</p></details> |  |

However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this survey, we (1) review progress across diverse scientific domains -- including fluid dynamics, weather and climate, quantum chemistry, and computational genomics -- that have begun adopting mixed-precision strategies; (2) examine state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques such as iterative refinement, splitting and emulation schemes, and adaptive precision solvers; (3) assess their implications for accuracy, performance, and resource utilization; and (4) survey the emerging software ecosystem that enables mixed-precision methods at scale. We conclude with perspectives and recommendations on cross-cutting opportunities, domain-specific challenges, and the role of co-design between application scientists, numerical analysts and computer scientists. Collectively, this survey underscores that mixed-precision numerics can reshape computational science by aligning algorithms with the evolving landscape of hardware capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of Supercomputing</p></details> |

This paper introduces ChatCFD, an automated agent system for OpenFOAM simulations that processes multi-modal inputs (e.g., research papers, meshes) via an interactive interface, leveraging DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 large language models, a multi-agent architecture, and OpenFOAM knowledge. Its four-stage pipeline (Knowledge Base Construction, User Input Processing, Case File Generation, and Execution and Error Reflection) enables iterative trial-reflection-refinement for intricate setups, supporting diverse physical models and external meshes. Validation on 205 benchmark tutorial cases, 110 perturbed variants, and 2 literature-derived cases shows ChatCFD's 82.1 percent operational success rate on basic cases, outperforming MetaOpenFOAM (6.2 percent) and Foam-Agent (42.3 percent), and 60-80 percent on literature-derived complex cases. Turbulence model studies show a 40 percent success rate for common models versus 10 percent for rare ones like RNG k-epsilon. Physics coupling analyses reveal higher resource demands for multi-physics-coupled cases, while LLM bias toward simpler setups introduces persistent errors, such as dimensional inconsistency. Ablation studies highlight the efficacy of RAG-based modules and reflection mechanisms. By automating hypothesis testing and parameter exploration, ChatCFD accelerates scientific discovery in fluid mechanics and engineering, addressing LLM limitations through structured design and showing strong potential as a modular component in MCP-based agent networks for collaborative multi-agent systems, paving the way for scalable AI-driven CFD innovation.

Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |

Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design stages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy stable finite difference methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity and knapsack limiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.14488</p></details> |
| **[A novel approach to study the wellposedness of the 3D fluid-2D plate interaction PDE System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03431v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a certain fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system with a view of obtaining an alternative methodology for establishing its strongly continuous semigroup wellposedness. (Semigroup generation for this FSI was originally considered in Avalos-Clark (2014).) The FSI model under consideration describes the vibrations of an incompressible fluid within a 3D cavity as it interacts with the elastic membrane on the ``free" upper boundary of the cavity. Such coupled PDE systems appear in variety of natural settings such as biomedicine, aeroelasticity, and fluid dynamics. Our proof of $C_0$-semigroup wellposedness is based on a proper application of Lumer Phillips Theorem. In this regard, our main challenge is to show the maximality of the corresponding semigroup generator. To this end, we develop a ``nonstandard" inf-sup approach which avoids the use of technical nonlocal maps in the associated bilinear forms--unlike the earlier paper Avalos-Clark (2014)--and allows for the solution of the fluid and plate solution variables simultanously. Our new inf-sup strategy will lead to a more efficient mixed finite element method (FEM) for approximating solutions to the FSI problem, inasmuch our novel variational formulation avoids bilinear forms which are free from the computationally-intensive nonlocal solution operators invoked in Avalos-Clark (2014). We also perform numerical tests based on this formulation using a benchmark problem and present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

Conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results, require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24 hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12 aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination (R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of design space within regulatory constraints.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Towards Digital Twins for Optimal Radioembolization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02607v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability. To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support. Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Processing and analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space, popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap, this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings that were overlooked by the community.</p></details> | 12 pages, 17 figures |

Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20615v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite Sample Analysis of Open-loop Subspace Identification Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16639v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subspace identification methods (SIMs) are known for their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical properties. However, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem. Following a three-step procedure generally used in SIMs, this work presents a finite sample analysis for open-loop SIMs. In Step 1 we begin with a parsimonious SIM. Leveraging a recent analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain a union error bound for a Hankel-like matrix constructed from a bank of ARX models. Step 2 involves model reduction via weighted singular value decomposition (SVD), where we use robustness results for SVD to obtain error bounds on extended controllability and observability matrices, respectively. The final Step 3 focuses on deriving error bounds for system matrices, where two different realization algorithms, the MOESP type and the CVA type, are studied. Our results not only agree with classical asymptotic results, but also show how much data is needed to guarantee a desired error bound with high probability. The proposed method generalizes related finite sample analyses and applies broadly to many variants of SIMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Order Participation Factor Computation via Batch-Structured Tensor Contraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08968v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

We define the problem of sensitivity-based parametric uncertainty quantification in dynamical system estimation. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel robustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with and without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics, and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on the robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting estimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and paves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward sensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication in the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |

A variational formulation is derived and analyzed leading to the well-posedness of the continuous problem and its Finite Element discretization. Then, the Reduced Basis Method through a greedy algorithm for parametric diffusion and reaction coefficients is analyzed. Its convergence properties, and in particular the decay of the Kolmogorov $n$-width, are seen to depend on the fractional order $s$. Finally, numerical results confirming our findings are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[A locking free multiscale method for linear elasticity in stress-displacement formulation with high contrast coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18054v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations for linear elasticity problems in high-contrast media poses a significant computational challenge. Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-precision energy conservative quadrature hyperreduction of Lagrangian hydrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21279v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an energy conservative, quadrature based model reduction framework for the compressible Euler equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics. Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 1 figure |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |

In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, Published in Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2025, DOI:/10.1016/j.amc.2025.129687</p></details> |

The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |

The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition, respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction, leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large and complex quantum systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for High-Dimensional Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09084v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is widely used for model reduction, its standard form does not take into account any parametric model structure. Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these either require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have limited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead assigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever the model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a posteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these weights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to compute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted POD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced basis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and snapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how these approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without the need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with and without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell thickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent partial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this problem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using weighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold interpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer high-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |

While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</p></details> |  |

By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |

Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error.

Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Tensor-based reduction of linear parameter-varying state-space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23591v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed to assess scalability.</p></details> |  |

The model class encompasses classical port-Hamiltonian systems, generalized gradient flows, and certain systems with algebraic constraints. Our framework combines existing ideas from the literature and systematically addresses temporal discretization, spatial discretization, and model order reduction, ensuring that all resulting schemes are dissipation-preserving in the sense of a discrete dissipation inequality. For this, we use a Petrov-Galerkin ansatz together with appropriate projections. Numerical results for a nonlinear circuit model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates for Nonintrusive Model Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nonlinear Causal Reductions to Explain Reinforcement Learning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14901v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expansive Natural Neural Gradient Flows for Energy Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13475v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops expansive gradient dynamics in deep neural network-induced mapping spaces. Specifically, we generate tools and concepts for minimizing a class of energy functionals in an abstract Hilbert space setting covering a wide scope of applications such as PDEs-based inverse problems and supervised learning. The approach hinges on a Hilbert space metric in the full diffeomorphism mapping space, which could be viewed as a generalized Wasserstein-2 metric. We then study a projection gradient descent method within deep neural network parameterized sets. More importantly, we develop an adaptation and expanding strategy to step-by-step enlarge the deep neural network structures. In particular, the expansion mechanism aims to enhance the alignment of the neural manifold induced natural gradient direction as well as possible with the ideal Hilbert space gradient descent direction leveraging the fact that we can evaluate projections of the Hilbert space gradient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for several simple model problems for energies arising in the context of supervised learning, model reduction, or inverse problems. In particular, we highlight the importance of assembling the neural flow matrix based on the inner product for the ambient Hilbert space. The actual algorithms are the simplest specifications of a broader spectrum based on a correspondingly wider discussion, postponing a detailed analysis to forthcoming work.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |
| **[Kernel-based Greedy Approximation of Parametric Elliptic Boundary Value Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06731v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We recently introduced a scale of kernel-based greedy schemes for approximating the solutions of elliptic boundary value problems. The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory. The resulting representation allows one to place error bounds on the $H_{\infty}$ norm on a reduced-order representation of the system computed using finite-dimensional nonlinear Controllability and Observability Gramians.</p></details> |  |
| **[An ensemble Kalman approach to randomized maximum likelihood estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03207v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes ensemble Kalman randomized maximum likelihood estimation, a new derivative-free method for performing randomized maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method that can be used to generate approximate samples from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems. The new method has connections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so that each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed optimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members converge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and, furthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior when applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method requires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data, be evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively expensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method tractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method tailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem. Theoretical results show near-optimality of this model reduction approach via convergence to an optimal approximation of the posterior covariance as a low-rank update to the prior covariance. Numerical experiments verify theoretical results and illustrate computational acceleration through model reduction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |
| **[Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum volume coordinates for Grassmann interpolation: Lagrange, Hermite, and errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01574v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to Riemannian interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. Instead of relying on the Riemannian normal coordinates, i.e. the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps, we approach the interpolation problem with an alternative set of local coordinates and corresponding parameterizations. A special property of these coordinates is that their calculation does not require any matrix decompositions. This is a numerical advantage over Riemann normal coordinates and many other retractions on the Grassmann manifold, especially when derivative data are to be treated. To estimate the interpolation error, we examine the conditioning of these mappings and state explicit bounds. It turns out that the parameterizations are well-conditioned, but the coordinate mappings are generally not. As a remedy, we introduce maximum-volume coordinates that are based on a search for subblocks of column-orthogonal matrices of large absolute determinant. We show that the order of magnitude of the asymptotic interpolation error on $\Gr(n,p)$ is the same as in the Euclidean space. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first is an academic one, where we interpolate a parametric orthogonal projector $QQ^T$, where the $Q$--factor stems from a parametric compact QR--decomposition. The second experiment is in the context of parametric model reduction of dynamical systems, where we interpolate reduced subspaces that are obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</p></details> |  |

Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 4 figures, 2 tables; 25 pages supplementary material, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Structure Identification of NDS with Descriptor Subsystems under Asynchronous, Non-Uniform, and Slow-Rate Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20319v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networked dynamic systems (NDS) exhibit collective behavior shaped by subsystem dynamics and complex interconnections, yet identifying these interconnections remains challenging due to irregularities in sampled data, including asynchronous, non-uniform, and low-rate sampling. This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, cdc2025</p></details> |

The EGPT-PINN extends the traditional physics-informed neural networks and its recently proposed generative pre-trained strategy for linear model reduction to nonlinear model reduction and shock-capturing domains. By utilizing an adaptive meta-network, a simultaneously trained transform layer, entropy enhancement strategies, implementable shock interaction analysis, and a separable training process, the EGPT-PINN efficiently captures complex parameter-dependent shock formations and interactions. Numerical results of EGPT-PINN applied to the families of inviscid Burgers' equation and the Euler equations, parameterized by their initial conditions, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed technique. It accurately solves the viscosity solution via very few neurons without leveraging any {\it a priori} knowledge of the equations or its initial condition. Moreover, via a simple augmentation of the loss function by model-data mismatch, we demonstrate the robustness of EGPT-PINN in solving inverse problems more accurately than the vanilla and entropy-enhanced versions of PINN.</p></details> | 24 pages,12 figures |
| **[Automatic and Structure-Aware Sparsification of Hybrid Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18996v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) integrate mechanistic models with neural ODEs, offering strong inductive bias and flexibility, and are particularly advantageous in data-scarce healthcare settings. However, excessive latent states and interactions from mechanistic models can lead to training inefficiency and over-fitting, limiting practical effectiveness of hybrid neural ODEs. In response, we propose a new hybrid pipeline for automatic state selection and structure optimization in mechanistic neural ODEs, combining domain-informed graph modifications with data-driven regularization to sparsify the model for improving predictive performance and stability while retaining mechanistic plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show improved predictive performance and robustness with desired sparsity, establishing an effective solution for hybrid model reduction in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Fick-Jacobs Derivation with Applications to Computational Branched Diffusion Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08247v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fick-Jacobs equation is a classical model reduction of 3-dimensional diffusion in a tube of varying radius to a 1-dimensional problem with radially scaled derivatives. This model has been shown to be unstable when the radial gradient is too steep. In this work, we present a new derivation of the Fick-Jacobs equation that results in the addition of higher order spatial derivative terms that provide additional stability in a wide variety of cases and improved solution convergence. We also derive new numerical schemes for branched nodes within networks and provide stability conditions for these schemes. The computational accuracy, efficiency, and stability of our method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical examples.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Neural empirical interpolation method for nonlinear model reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03562v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the neural empirical interpolation method (NEIM), a neural network-based alternative to the discrete empirical interpolation method for reducing the time complexity of computing the nonlinear term in a reduced order model (ROM) for a parameterized nonlinear partial differential equation. NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some "optimal" coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.

| **[Application of a Novel Model Reduction Technique to the Assessment of Boundedness/Stability of Some Delay Time-Varying Vector Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11398v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains a challenging problem with broad applications in science and engineering. Existing methods tend to produce overly conservative criteria that offer limited practical value and often fail to explicitly characterize the temporal evolution of solution norms. This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the evolution of solution norms in such systems. This approach constructs scalar counterparts for the original vector equations. We prove that the solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also include delays and variable coefficients, provide upper bounds for the norms of the original solutions, if the history functions for both equations are properly matched. This reduction enables the evaluation of the boundedness and stability of vector systems through the analysis of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, which can be performed via straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. Consequently, we introduce new criteria for boundedness and stability and estimate the radii of the balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems. Finally, we validated our inferences through representative simulations that also assessed the accuracy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 18 pages |

An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper.

| **[Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a weighted balanced truncation to construct an optimal model reduction method for compressing the number of exponentials in the sum-of-exponentials approximation of kernel functions. This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate its excellent performance and attractive features for practical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems by multivariate rational interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03057v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal approximation of linear dynamical systems with quadratic-output functions, also known as linear quadratic-output systems. Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their relevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is leveraged to delineate both known and new design methodologies for control and observation of cascades, and to characterize structural properties of reduced models. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic categorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for observation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear time-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for nonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly comprehensive nonlinear theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, revised version</p></details> |
| **[Generative Learning for Slow Manifolds and Bifurcation Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20375v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit. In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Aerial Image Classification in Scarce and Unconstrained Environments via Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17655v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Benefits of Memory for Modeling Time-Dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02313v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUPRA: Subspace Parameterized Attention for Neural Operator on General Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15897v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators are efficient surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their key components face challenges: (1) in order to improve accuracy, attention mechanisms suffer from computational inefficiency on large-scale meshes, and (2) spectral convolutions rely on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on regular grids and assume a flat geometry, which causes accuracy degradation on irregular domains. To tackle these problems, we regard the matrix-vector operations in the standard attention mechanism on vectors in Euclidean space as bilinear forms and linear operators in vector spaces and generalize the attention mechanism to function spaces. This new attention mechanism is fully equivalent to the standard attention but impossible to compute due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces. To address this, inspired by model reduction techniques, we propose a Subspace Parameterized Attention (SUPRA) neural operator, which approximates the attention mechanism within a finite-dimensional subspace. To construct a subspace on irregular domains for SUPRA, we propose using the Laplacian eigenfunctions, which naturally adapt to domains' geometry and guarantee the optimal approximation for smooth functions. Experiments show that the SUPRA neural operator reduces error rates by up to 33% on various PDE datasets while maintaining state-of-the-art computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and inference in error-in-operator model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11834v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many statistical problems can be reduced to a linear inverse problem in which only a noisy version of the operator is available. Particular examples include random design regression, deconvolution problem, instrumental variable regression, functional data analysis, error-in-variable regression, drift estimation in stochastic diffusion, and many others. The pragmatic plug-in approach can be well justified in the classical asymptotic setup with a growing sample size. However, recent developments in high dimensional inference reveal some new features of this problem. In high dimensional linear regression with a random design, the plug-in approach is questionable but the use of a simple ridge penalization yields a benign overfitting phenomenon; see \cite{baLoLu2020}, \cite{ChMo2022}, \cite{NoPuSp2024}. This paper revisits the general Error-in-Operator problem for finite samples and high dimension of the source and image spaces. A particular focus is on the choice of a proper regularization. We show that a simple ridge penalty (Tikhonov regularization) works properly in the case when the operator is more regular than the signal. In the opposite case, some model reduction technique like spectral truncation should be applied.</p></details> |  |

A prominent contemporary example is from aerospace propulsion, where HPC is used for rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) simulations in support of the design of next-generation rocket engines; however, these simulations take millions of core hours even on powerful supercomputers, which makes them impractical for engineering tasks like design exploration and risk assessment. Data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) aim to address this limitation by constructing computationally cheap yet sufficiently accurate approximations that serve as surrogates for the high-fidelity model. This paper contributes a distributed memory algorithm that achieves fast and scalable construction of predictive physics-based ROMs trained from sparse datasets of extremely large state dimension. The algorithm learns structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets.This enables model reduction for problems at a scale and complexity that exceeds the capabilities of standard, serial approaches. We demonstrate our algorithm's scalability using up to $2,048$ cores on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We focus on a real-world three-dimensional RDRE for which one millisecond of simulated physical time requires one million core hours on a supercomputer. Using a training dataset of $2,536$ snapshots each of state dimension $76$ million, our distributed algorithm enables the construction of a predictive data-driven reduced model in just $13$ seconds on $2,048$ cores on Frontera.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</p></details> |  |

A human-inspired paradigm was designed for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |

Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Computational Science Graduate Project</p></details> |

This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |

| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |

The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system's infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. We validate the proposed framework on a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Chebyshev--Ritz Spectral Framework for Nonlinear Vibration of CNT-Reinforced Composite Beams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11946v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a spectral Ritz formulation for the nonlinear free vibration analysis of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) beams. Boundary-adapted Chebyshev basis functions are constructed to exactly satisfy clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The governing equations incorporate von~K\'{a}rm\'{a}n geometric nonlinearity, while the effective material properties for both uniform and functionally graded (FG) CNT distributions are evaluated using a modified rule of mixtures. Discretization via the Chebyshev-Ritz approach produces a reduced-order model exhibiting exponential convergence; for basis sizes $N \geq 12$, the fundamental frequency error remains below $0.1\%$ relative to published benchmarks. Computational results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains, with the spectral approach requiring significantly less time than high-fidelity finite element discretizations of comparable accuracy. Parametric studies reveal that the fundamental frequency increases with CNT volume fraction and is sensitive to the interfacial load-transfer efficiency parameter $\eta_E$. Selected FG patterns are shown to enhance stiffness relative to uniformly distributed CNTs. Validation against established numerical benchmarks yields relative differences of only a few percent. The current limitation of the method is its reliance on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumption, which neglects transverse shear deformation and damping; addressing these effects is proposed for future work. All numerical data and scripts are provided as supplementary material to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language model-empowered next-generation computer-aided engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11447v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate normal-forms for the numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of navier-stokes flows via machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21275v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate how the embed-learn-lift framework enables the construction of surrogate global normal-forms, namely minimal-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs), from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations. These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Global Model Reduction Learning in Porous Media Flow Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09335v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we combine deep learning concepts and some proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model reduction methods for predicting flow in heterogeneous porous media. Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

This paper presents a computationally efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%, and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains, including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2025</p></details> |
| **[Taming High-Dimensional Dynamics: Learning Optimal Projections onto Spectral Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03157v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional nonlinear systems pose considerable challenges for modeling and control across many domains, from fluid mechanics to advanced robotics. Such systems are typically approximated with reduced-order models, which often rely on orthogonal projections, a simplification that may lead to large prediction errors. In this work, we derive optimality of fiber-aligned projections onto spectral submanifolds, preserving the nonlinear geometric structure and minimizing long-term prediction error. We propose a data-driven procedure to learn these projections from trajectories and demonstrate its effectiveness through a 180-dimensional robotic system. Our reduced-order models achieve up to fivefold improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoencoder-based non-intrusive model order reduction in continuum mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02237v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters. To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive. These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v4)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00294v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</p></details> |  |

Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally, moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

A core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii) specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple, task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required to design DTs. In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models. It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power-Series Approach to Moment-Matching-Based Model Reduction of MIMO Polynomial Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13595v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The model reduction problem for high-order multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) polynomial nonlinear systems based on moment matching is addressed. The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced-order modeling of Hamiltonian dynamics based on symplectic neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11911v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM) framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11542v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.</p></details> |  |

The proposed technique considers the microscopic eigenstrain field accounting for intra-phase damage and inelastic strains. This results in realistic computations by alleviating the post-damage stiffness response, which is a drawback of TFA-based methods. We attain computational efficiency by identifying the preprocessing data solely from the elastic and eigen transformation functions and adopting a reduced order modelling technique with a piecewise constant eigenstrain field throughout the subdomains. The performance of the model is assessed by simulating the response for (a) the representative volume element (RVE) as a homogenized continuum and (b) the various composites under complex load histories with intricate macroscale morphologies. Furthermore, the nonlinear shear stress-strain response of a glass fiber composite is calculated and compared to experimentally measured fracture initiation parameters, failure plane orientation, and strain histories. Finally, we show that $\mathtt{E}^2$-TFA can accurately and efficiently capture damage and inelastic deformations in order to estimate the mechanical response of composite materials in a better way.</p></details> | 40 pages, 21 figures |

The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Collocation Point Strategies For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700v4)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose two adaptive collocation point selection strategies utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approaches improve PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</p></details> |  |

The approach begins with the introduction of innovative monolithic and global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithms, which incorporate the backward differentiation formulas for time discretization. In each iteration, these algorithms involve solving a diffusion subproblem over the entire temporal domain, followed by solving a generalized Stokes subproblem over the same time interval. To accelerate the global-in-time iterative process, we present a reduced order modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition, aimed at reducing the primary computational cost from the generalized Stokes subproblem. The effectiveness of this novel method is validated both theoretically and through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A parameterized Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow approach for solving the Schrödinger equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11762v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new method to compute the solution of time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE). Using push-forward maps and Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow, we reformulate the TDSE as a Hamiltonian system in terms of push-forward maps. The new formulation can be viewed as a generative model in the Wasserstein space, which is a manifold of probability density functions. Then we parameterize the push-forward maps by reduce-order models such as neural networks. This induces a new metric in the parameter space by pulling back the Wasserstein metric on density manifold, which further results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters of the reduce-order model. Leveraging the computational techniques from deep learning, such as Neural ODE, we design an algorithm to solve the TDSE in the parameterized push-forward map space, which provides an alternative approach with the potential to scale up to high-dimensional problems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Order Data-driven Twin Models for Nonlinear PDEs by Randomized Koopman Orthogonal Decomposition and Explainable Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03325v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a data-driven twin modeling framework based on modern Koopman operator theory, offering a significant advancement over classical modal decomposition by accurately capturing nonlinear dynamics with reduced complexity and no manual parameter adjustment. The method integrates a novel algorithm with Pareto front analysis to construct a compact, high-fidelity reduced-order model that balances accuracy and efficiency. An explainable NLARX deep learning framework enables real-time, adaptive calibration and prediction, while a key innovation-computing orthogonal Koopman modes via randomized orthogonal projections-ensures optimal data representation. This approach for data-driven twin modeling is fully self-consistent, avoiding heuristic choices and enhancing interpretability through integrated explainable learning techniques. The proposed method is demonstrated on shock wave phenomena using three experiments of increasing complexity, accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the resulting data-driven twin models.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |

The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</p></details> |  |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Continuous- and Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18131v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse scattering for Schrödinger equation in the frequency domain via data-driven reduced order modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11034v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we develop a numerical method for solving an inverse scattering problem of estimating the scattering potential in a Schr\"{o}dinger equation from frequency domain measurements based on reduced order models (ROM). The ROM is a projection of Schr\"{o}dinger operator onto a subspace spanned by its solution snapshots at certain wavenumbers. Provided the measurements are performed at these wavenumbers, the ROM can be constructed in a data-driven manner from the measurements on a surface surrounding the scatterers. Once the ROM is computed, the scattering potential can be estimated using non-linear optimization that minimizes the ROM misfit. Such an approach typically outperforms the conventional methods based on data misfit minimization. We develop two variants of ROM-based algorithms for inverse scattering and test them on a synthetic example in two spatial dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers based on an ALE approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13613v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a Galerkin projection-based reduced-order modelling (ROM) approach for segregated fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, formulated within an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework at low Reynolds numbers using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is constructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and incorporates a data-driven technique that combines classical Galerkin projection with radial basis function (RBF) networks. The results demonstrate the numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed method relative to the high-fidelity model. The ROM successfully captures transient flow fields and, importantly, the forces acting on the moving structure without exhibiting unphysical growth or divergence over time. This is further supported by the bounded evolution of error metrics and physical observables, which remain consistent with the full-order simulations throughout the prediction horizon. The method's effectiveness is validated through a benchmark vortex-induced vibration (VIV) case involving a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=200. The hybrid ROM approach yields an accurate and efficient tool for solving FSI problems involving mesh motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow singular value decay. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method, but with a data-driven basis. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying the space-local POD, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions compared to standard POD, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method. Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D and 2D advection equation. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, source code can be found at https://github.com/tobyvg/local_POD_overlap.jl</p></details> |

We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.</p></details> |  |

The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |
| **[Adaptive Reduced Basis Trust Region Methods for Parabolic Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11130v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider nonlinear inverse problems arising in the context of parameter identification for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). For stable reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems. The implementation is made available for reproducibility and further use.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

For both the continuous and the discrete (finite element) settings, we prove that the new strategy yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers that were not covered by current results. We also show that the new feedback control yields more accurate results than the current control approaches in marginally-resolved numerical simulations of a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=1000$. We note, however, that for realistic control parameters, the stabilizing effect of the new feedback control strategy is not sufficient in the convection-dominated regime. Our second contribution is the development of an adaptive evolve-filter-relax (aEFR) regularization that stabilizes marginally-resolved simulations in the convection-dominated regime and increases the accuracy of the new feedback control in realistic parameter settings. For the finite element setting, we prove that the novel feedback control equipped with the new aEFR method yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, our numerical investigation shows that the new strategy yields accurate results for reduced order models that dramatically decrease the size of the feedback control problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors. The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively. Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder QR. For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for highly ill-conditioned matrices. The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments on a laptop and computation server.</p></details> | Preprint |

The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

The evaluation of objective and constraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used to explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models are sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control problem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions requires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE). The models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the Boussinesq PDE.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 17 figures, pre-print</p></details> |

| **[Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of improved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajectories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform comprehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

| **[Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine Using Koopman Eigenfunction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10438v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 28 figures Under review at Springer Nonlinear Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Learning Framework for Evaluating Dynamic Network Generative Models and Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11901v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding dynamic systems like disease outbreaks, social influence, and information diffusion requires effective modeling of complex networks. Traditional evaluation methods for static networks often fall short when applied to temporal networks. This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507). These findings highlight DGSP-GCN's effectiveness in evaluating and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks, offering valuable insights for network evolution and anomaly detection research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gradient Descent is a Hypergraph Functor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19845v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ACT 2024, arXiv:2509.18357</p></details> |
| **[PALQO: Physics-informed Model for Accelerating Large-scale Quantum Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20733v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20615v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Function Spaces Without Kernels: Learning Compact Hilbert Space Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20605v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and principled at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previously under review at ICLR 2025, originally submitted on the 12th of May 2025.

| **[MDBench: Benchmarking Data-Driven Methods for Model Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20529v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages without appendix, 22 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework, \textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM, LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second, we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks. Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization, capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Deep vs. shallow learning of transfer operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19930v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover, it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems, and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum harmonic oscillator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Field Theory: A General Mathematical Framework for Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large language models and present empirical results using large language models as experimental probes of societal cognition.</p></details> |  |

Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on two subsets (FD001, FD003) of the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan engine degradation. TDC-AE machtes LSTMs and outperforms Transformers while achieving a nearly 100x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Atmospheric Super-Resolution With Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22780v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained, score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rice-like complexity lower bounds for Boolean and uniform automata networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08762v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automata networks are a versatile model of finite discrete dynamical systems composed of interacting entities (the automata), able to embed any directed graph as a dynamics on its space of configurations (the set of vertices, representing all the assignments of a state to each entity). In this world, virtually any question is decidable by a simple exhaustive search. We lever the Rice-like complexity lower bound, stating that any non-trivial monadic second order logic question on the graph of its dynamics is NP-hard or coNP-hard (given the automata network description), to bounded alphabets (including the Boolean case). This restriction is particularly meaningful for applications to "complex systems", where each entity has a restricted set of possible states (its alphabet). For the deterministic case, trivial questions are solvable in constant time, hence there is a sharp gap in complexity for the algorithmic solving of concrete problems on them. For the non-deterministic case, non-triviality is defined at bounded cliquewidth, which offers a structure to establish metatheorems of complexity lower bounds.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

However, neural populations are often modeled as autonomous dynamical systems, with little consideration given to the influence of external inputs that shape the population activity and behavioral outcomes. Here, we introduce BRAID, a deep learning framework that models nonlinear neural dynamics underlying behavior while explicitly incorporating any measured external inputs. Our method disentangles intrinsic recurrent neural population dynamics from the effects of inputs by including a forecasting objective within input-driven recurrent neural networks. BRAID further prioritizes the learning of intrinsic dynamics that are related to a behavior of interest by using a multi-stage optimization scheme. We validate BRAID with nonlinear simulations, showing that it can accurately learn the intrinsic dynamics shared between neural and behavioral modalities. We then apply BRAID to motor cortical activity recorded during a motor task and demonstrate that our method more accurately fits the neural-behavioral data by incorporating measured sensory stimuli into the model and improves the forecasting of neural-behavioral data compared with various baseline methods, whether input-driven or not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025.

| **[Flow marching for a generative PDE foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18611v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Dynamics of Acceleration in First order Gradient Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18346v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ever since the original algorithm by Nesterov (1983), the true nature of the acceleration phenomenon has remained elusive, with various interpretations of why the method is actually faster. The diagnosis of the algorithm through the lens of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and the corresponding dynamical system formulation to explain the underlying dynamics has a rich history. In the literature, the ODEs that explain algorithms are typically derived by considering the limiting case of the algorithm maps themselves, that is, an ODE formulation follows the development of an algorithm. This obfuscates the underlying higher order principles and thus provides little evidence of the working of the algorithm. Such has been the case with Nesterov algorithm and the various analogies used to describe the acceleration phenomena, viz, momentum associated with the rolling of a Heavy-Ball down a slope, Hessian damping etc. The main focus of our work is to ideate the genesis of the Nesterov algorithm from the viewpoint of dynamical systems leading to demystifying the mathematical rigour behind the algorithm. Instead of reverse engineering ODEs from discrete algorithms, this work explores tools from the recently developed control paradigm titled Passivity and Immersion approach and the Geometric Singular Perturbation theory which are applied to arrive at the formulation of a dynamical system that explains and models the acceleration phenomena. This perspective helps to gain insights into the various terms present and the sequence of steps used in Nesterovs accelerated algorithm for the smooth strongly convex and the convex case. The framework can also be extended to derive the acceleration achieved using the triple momentum method and provides justifications for the non-convergence to the optimal solution in the Heavy-Ball method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuromorphic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11940v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which suffer from the Von Neumann bottleneck and depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from a wide range of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, cognitive science and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Equilibrium flow: From Snapshots to Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17990v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific data, from cellular snapshots in biology to celestial distributions in cosmology, often consists of static patterns from underlying dynamical systems. These snapshots, while lacking temporal ordering, implicitly encode the processes that preserve them. This work investigates how strongly such a distribution constrains its underlying dynamics and how to recover them. We introduce the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous dynamics that preserve a given pattern distribution. Our method successfully identifies plausible dynamics for 2-D systems and recovers the signature chaotic behavior of the Lorenz attractor. For high-dimensional Turing patterns from the Gray-Scott model, we develop an efficient, training-free variant that achieves high fidelity to the ground truth, validated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis reveals the solution space is constrained not only by the data but also by the learning model's inductive biases. This capability extends beyond recovering known systems, enabling a new paradigm of inverse design for Artificial Life. By specifying a target pattern distribution, we can discover the local interaction rules that preserve it, leading to the spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors, such as life-like flocking, attraction, and repulsion patterns, from simple, user-defined snapshots.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, the most mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion concerns how to generate and stabilize near-steady-state, single-mode locomotion (e.g. walk, run). We know little about how to use physical interaction to make robust locomotor transitions. Here, we review our progress towards filling this gap by discovering terradynamic principles of multi-legged locomotor transitions, using simplified model systems representing distinct challenges in complex three-dimensional terrain. Remarkably, general physical principles emerge across diverse model systems, by modelling locomotor-terrain interaction using a potential energy landscape approach. The animal and robots' stereotyped locomotor modes are constrained by physical interaction. Locomotor transitions are stochastic, destabilizing, barrier-crossing transitions on the landscape. They can be induced by feed-forward self-propulsion and are facilitated by feedbackcontrolled active adjustment. General physical principles and strategies from our systematic studies already advanced robot performance in simple model systems. Efforts remain to better understand the intelligence aspect of locomotor transitions and how to compose larger-scale potential energy landscapes of complex three-dimensional terrains from simple landscapes of abstracted challenges. This will elucidate how the neuromechanical control system mediates physical interaction to generate multi-pathway locomotor transitions and lead to advancements in biology, physics, robotics and dynamical systems theory.</p></details> |  |

Our approach builds on multi-resolution approximate bisimulations, a generalisation of classical $\epsilon$-approximate bisimulations, that support state-dependent error bounds and subsumes both variable- and uniform-resolution relations. We show that some systems admit multi-resolution bisimulations but no $\epsilon$-approximate bisimulation. We prove the existence of multi-resolution approximately bisimilar abstractions for all incrementally uniformly bounded ($\delta$-UB) systems, thereby broadening the applicability of symbolic verification to a larger class of dynamics; as a trivial special case, this result also covers incrementally globally asymptotically stable ($\delta$-GAS) systems. The Multi-resolution Abstraction Synthesis Problem (MRASP) is solved via a scalable Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) loop, combining mesh refinement with counterexample-driven refinement. This ensures soundness for all $\delta$-UB systems, and ensures termination in certain special cases. Experiments on linear and nonlinear benchmarks, including non-$\delta$-GAS and non-differentiable cases, demonstrate that our algorithm yields abstractions up to 50\% smaller than Lyapunov-based grids while enforcing tighter, location-dependent error guarantees.</p></details> |  |

As a first step, this paper studies a biobjective optimization problem in a simple nonlinear switched dynamical system: a piecewise linear system based on a boost converter with photovoltaic input. The piecewise linearity enables us to analyze the nonlinear dynamics exactly. In the biobjective optimization problem, the first objective evaluates stability of circuit operation and the second objective evaluates average input power. A main task is analysis of a trade-off between the two objectives. Using the piecewise exact solutions, the two objectives are formulated theoretically. Using the theoretical formulae, the existence of a trade-off between the two objectives is clarified exactly. Relationship between the trade-off and parameters is also considered. The results provide fundamental information to analyze multiobjective optimization problems in various nonlinear systems and to realize their engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

At any time step, the estimator has access to measurements from a randomly selected sensor from a pool of sensors with pre-specified models and noise profiles. A Luenberger-like observer is used to fuse the measurements with the underlying model of the system to recursively generate the state estimates. An additive privacy-preserving noise is used to constrain information leakage. Information leakage is measured via mutual information between the identity of the sensors and the state estimate conditioned on the actual state of the system. This captures an omnipotent adversary that not only can access state estimates but can also gather direct high-quality state measurements. Any prescribed level of information leakage is shown to be achievable by appropriately selecting the variance of the privacy-preserving noise. Therefore, privacy-utility trade-off can be fine-tuned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 17th IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Bayesian Dynamical System Model of Joint Action and Interpersonal Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08811v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the "context matrix" as one such representation. The context matrix, modeled within a linear dynamical system, has psychologically interpretable entries specifying how much each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member's past behaviors. Critically, these entries can be distilled into summary features that represent synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we demonstrate that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics in joint action.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Kernel Methods for Learning Hamiltonian Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17154v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian dynamics describe a wide range of physical systems. As such, data-driven simulations of Hamiltonian systems are important for many scientific and engineering problems. In this work, we propose kernel-based methods for identifying and forecasting Hamiltonian systems directly from data. We present two approaches: a two-step method that reconstructs trajectories before learning the Hamiltonian, and a one-step method that jointly infers both. Across several benchmark systems, including mass-spring dynamics, a nonlinear pendulum, and the Henon-Heiles system, we demonstrate that our framework achieves accurate, data-efficient predictions and outperforms two-step kernel-based baselines, particularly in scarce-data regimes, while preserving the conservation properties of Hamiltonian dynamics. Moreover, our methodology provides theoretical a priori error estimates, ensuring reliability of the learned models. We also provide a more general, problem-agnostic numerical framework that goes beyond Hamiltonian systems and can be used for data-driven learning of arbitrary dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GN-SINDy: Greedy Sampling Neural Network in Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08613v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) is a data-driven technique employed for uncovering and representing the fundamental dynamics of intricate systems based on observational data. However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery</p></details> |  |

This setup reflects implicit communication, as the controller embeds a message in the control signal. The capacity of a control system is the maximal reliable rate of the embedded message subject to a closed-loop control-cost constraint. We focus on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control systems, in which the dynamical system is given by a state-space model with Gaussian noise, and the control cost is a quadratic function of the system inputs and system states. Our main result is a convex optimization upper bound on the capacity of LQG systems. In the case of scalar systems, we prove that the upper bound yields the exact LQG system capacity. The upper bound also recovers all known results, including LQG control, feedback capacity of Gaussian channels with memory, and the LQG system capacity with a state-feedback. For vector LQG control systems, we provide a sufficient condition for tightness of the upper bound, based on the Riccati equation. Numerical simulations indicate the upper bound tightness in all tested examples, suggesting that the upper bound may be equal to the LQG system capacity in the vector case as well.</p></details> |  |
| **[System Relaxation for Interpretable and Adaptive Network Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16984v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing network control strategies, which rely on static shortest-path logic, suffer from catastrophic "stress concentration" on critical nodes. This paper introduces the System Relaxation Algorithm (SRA), a new control paradigm inspired by physical relaxation that guides a network toward an emergent equilibrium of load balance. SRA is an interpretable, 'white-box' dynamical system whose behavior is profoundly topology-dependent: in heterogeneous networks, it acts as a proactive performance optimizer, reducing peak centrality by over 80\% and increasing high-load throughput by more than 45\%; in homogeneous topologies, its objective intelligently shifts to resilience enhancement. We rigorously prove its global convergence and practical stability using the theory of non-smooth dynamical systems, establishing a predictable paradigm for network governance that intelligently trades off performance and resilience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized Space-Time Sampling for Affine Graph Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16818v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of dynamical sampling for graph signals influenced by a constant source term. We consider signals evolving over time according to a linear dynamical system on a graph, where both the initial state and the source term are bandlimited. We introduce two random space-time sampling regimes and analyze the conditions under which stable recovery is achievable. While our framework extends recent work on homogeneous dynamics, it addresses a fundamentally different setting where the evolution includes a constant source term. This results in a non-orthogonal-diagonalizable system matrix, rendering classical spectral techniques inapplicable and introducing new challenges in sampling design, stability analysis, and joint recovery of both the initial state and the forcing term. A key component of our analysis is the spectral graph weighted coherence, which characterizes the interplay between the sampling distribution and the graph structure. We establish sampling complexity bounds ensuring stable recovery via the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and develop a robust recovery algorithm with provable error guarantees. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[HypeMARL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning For High-Dimensional, Parametric, and Distributed Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16709v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising feedback control strategy for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional, parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents, outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and (iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of ~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTCAE: ViT-based Class-conditioned Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16554v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.</p></details> | - |
| **[Statistical Inference for Misspecified Contextual Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06287v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive experiments to balance bias and variance. Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals, and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Uniqueness of Participation Factors in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07156v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</p></details> | Accepted |
| **[Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices for Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10069v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments on SciML tasks and other improvements</p></details> |
| **[Object Tracking Incorporating Transfer Learning into Unscented and Cubature Kalman Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07157v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[FlowCast-ODE: Continuous Hourly Weather Forecasting with Dynamic Flow Matching and ODE Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14775v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications. Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's 12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow. FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state, an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15% without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons. Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with assimilation cycle transitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Conservative Neural Control Barrier Functions from Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00908v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms for such filters, however, suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we add to this set of approaches an algorithm for training neural control barrier functions from offline datasets. Such functions can be used to design constraints for quadratic programs that are then used as safety filters. Our algorithm trains these functions so that the system is not only prevented from reaching unsafe states but is also disincentivized from reaching out-of-distribution ones, at which they would be less reliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety while minimally affecting task performance. Source code is available at https://github.com/tabz23/CCBF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Data Denoising and Derivative Estimation for Data-Driven Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14219v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR) fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gremban Expansion for Signed Networks: Algebraic and Combinatorial Foundations for Community-Faction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14193v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article deals with the characterization and detection of community and faction structures in signed networks. We approach the study of these mesoscale structures through the lens of the Gremban expansion. This graph operation lifts a signed graph to a larger unsigned graph, and allows the extension of standard techniques from unsigned to signed graphs. We develop the combinatorial and algebraic properties of the Gremban expansion, with a focus on its inherent involutive symmetry. The main technical result is a bijective correspondence between symmetry-respecting cut-sets in the Gremban expansion, and regular cut-sets and frustration sets in the signed graph (i.e., the combinatorial structures that underlie communities and factions respectively). This result forms the basis for our new approach to community-faction detection in signed networks, which makes use of spectral clustering techniques that naturally respect the required symmetries. We demonstrate how this approach distinguishes the two mesoscale structures, how to generalize the approach to multi-way clustering and discuss connections to network dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Identifying Network Structure of Linear Dynamical Systems: Observability and Edge Misclassification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14065v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the limitations of uniquely identifying a linear network's topology from partial measurements of its nodes. We show that the set of networks that are consistent with the measurements are related through the nullspace of the observability matrix for the true network. In doing so, we illustrate how potentially many networks are fully consistent with the measurements despite having topologies that are structurally inconsistent with each other, an often neglected consideration in the design of topology inference methods. We then provide an aggregate characterization of the space of possible networks by analytically solving for the most structurally dissimilar network. We find that when observing over 6% of nodes in random network models (e.g., Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Watts-Strogatz) the rate of edge misclassification drops to ~1%. Extending this discussion, we construct a family of networks that keep measurements $\epsilon$-"close" to each other, and connect the identifiability of these networks to the spectral properties of an augmented observability Gramian.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, in submission</p></details> |
| **[Rigorous Function Calculi in Ariadne](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17541v5)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Almost all problems in applied mathematics, including the analysis of dynamical systems, deal with spaces of real-valued functions on Euclidean domains in their formulation and solution. In this paper, we describe the the tool Ariadne, which provides a rigorous calculus for working with Euclidean functions. We first introduce the Ariadne framework, which is based on a clean separation of objects as providing exact, effective, validated and approximate information. We then discuss the function calculus as implemented in Ariadne, including polynomial function models which are the fundamental class for concrete computations. We then consider solution of some core problems of functional analysis, namely solution of algebraic equations and differential equations, and briefly discuss their use for the analysis of hybrid systems. We will give examples of C++ and Python code for performing the various calculations. Finally, we will discuss progress on extensions, including improvements to the function calculus and extensions to more complicated classes of system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual modulation of language comprehension in a dynamic neural model of lexical meaning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14701v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We computationally implement and experimentally test the behavioral predictions of a dynamic neural model of lexical meaning in the framework of Dynamic Field Theory. We demonstrate the architecture and behavior of the model using as a test case the English lexical item have, focusing on its polysemous use. In the model, have maps to a semantic space defined by two independently motivated continuous conceptual dimensions, connectedness and control asymmetry. The mapping is modeled as coupling between a neural node representing the lexical item and neural fields representing the conceptual dimensions. While lexical knowledge is modeled as a stable coupling pattern, real-time lexical meaning retrieval is modeled as the motion of neural activation patterns between transiently stable states corresponding to semantic interpretations or readings. Model simulations capture two previously reported empirical observations: (1) contextual modulation of lexical semantic interpretation, and (2) individual variation in the magnitude of this modulation. Simulations also generate a novel prediction that the by-trial relationship between sentence reading time and acceptability should be contextually modulated. An experiment combining self-paced reading and acceptability judgments replicates previous results and partially bears out the model's novel prediction. Altogether, results support a novel perspective on lexical polysemy: that the many related meanings of a word are not categorically distinct representations; rather, they are transiently stable neural activation states that arise from the nonlinear dynamics of neural populations governing interpretation on continuous semantic dimensions. Our model offers important advantages over related models in the dynamical systems framework, as well as models based on Bayesian inference.</p></details> |  |

We explore scenarios where different candidate topologies can yield similar measurements, thus limiting identifiability. To do so, we apply the contraction theory framework to facilitate comparisons between candidate topologies. We show that semicontraction in the observable space is a sufficient condition for two systems to become indistinguishable from one another based on partial measurements. We apply this framework to study networks of Kuramoto oscillators, and discuss scenarios in which different topologies (both connected and disconnected) become indistinguishable.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, in submission</p></details> |
| **[Safety Critical Model Predictive Control Using Discrete-Time Control Density Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13257v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents MPC-CDF, a new approach integrating control density functions (CDFs) within a model predictive control (MPC) framework to ensure safety-critical control in nonlinear dynamical systems. By using the dual formulation of the navigation problem, we incorporate CDFs into the MPC framework, ensuring both convergence and safety in a discrete-time setting. These density functions are endowed with a physical interpretation, where the associated measure signifies the occupancy of system trajectories. Leveraging this occupancy-based perspective, we synthesize safety-critical controllers using the proposed MPC-CDF framework. We illustrate the safety properties of this framework using a unicycle model and compare it with a control barrier function-based method. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the autonomous safe navigation of an underwater vehicle, which avoids complex and arbitrary obstacles while achieving the desired level of safety.</p></details> |  |
