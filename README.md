| **[Particle Image Velocimetry Refinement via Consensus ADMM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11695v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an imaging technique in experimental fluid dynamics that quantifies flow fields around bluff bodies by analyzing the displacement of neutrally buoyant tracer particles immersed in the fluid. Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/flowgym</p></details> |
| **[FloraForge: LLM-Assisted Procedural Generation of Editable and Analysis-Ready 3D Plant Geometric Models For Agricultural Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11925v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D plant models are crucial for computational phenotyping and physics-based simulation; however, current approaches face significant limitations. Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blood Pressure Prediction for Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10765v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[MFC 5.0: An exascale many-physics flow solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07953v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems of interest in engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences rely on high-fidelity flow simulation, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers a mainstay of the open-source software community. Previous work, MFC 3.0, was published, documented, and made open-source by Bryngelson et al. CPC (2021) features numerous physical features, numerical methods, and scalable infrastructure. MFC 5.0 is a significant update to MFC 3.0, featuring a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods, as well as the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF's Frontier and LLNL's El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-accelerator performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice and has achieved the largest-to-date public CFD simulation at 200 trillion grid points, earning it a 2025 ACM Gordon Bell Prize finalist. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF's Summit and Frontier, and LLNL's El Capitan, achieves efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-fold increase in device count show parallel efficiencies exceeding 90% on OLCF Frontier.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SynthPix supports the same configuration parameters as existing tools but achieves a throughput several orders of magnitude higher in image-pair generation per second. SynthPix was developed to enable the training of data-hungry reinforcement learning methods for flow estimation and for reducing the iteration times during the development of fast flow estimation methods used in recent active fluids control studies with real-time PIV feedback. We believe SynthPix to be useful for the fluid dynamics community, and in this paper we describe the main ideas behind this software package.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/synthpix</p></details> |
| **[Rates and architectures for learning geometrically non-trivial operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09376v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive. We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields. This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Urban Flow Modeling: From Geometry to Airflow with Graph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14725v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViSA: 3D-Aware Video Shading for Real-Time Upper-Body Avatar Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07720v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

| **[CFD-copilot: leveraging domain-adapted large language model and model context protocol to enhance simulation automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07917v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations requires significant expertise in physics modeling and numerical methods, posing a barrier to non-specialists. Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction with Physics-Informed Machine Learning and Immersed Boundary Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565v5)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with moving interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSPT: Efficient Large-Scale Physical Modeling via Parallelized Multi-Scale Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01738v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation: A Perspective from Computational Fluid Dynamics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01319v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx. Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit. Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p></details> |  |

We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22819v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Data efficient surrogate modeling for engineering design: Ensemble-free batch mode deep active learning for regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10360v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High fidelity design evaluation processes such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis are often replaced with data driven surrogates to reduce computational cost in engineering design optimization. However, building accurate surrogate models still requires a large number of expensive simulations. To address this challenge, we introduce epsilon HQS, a scalable active learning strategy that leverages a student teacher framework to train deep neural networks efficiently. Unlike Bayesian AL methods, which are computationally demanding with DNNs, epsilon HQS selectively queries informative samples to reduce labeling cost. Applied to CFD, FEA, and propeller design tasks, our method achieves higher accuracy under fixed labeling cost budgets.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompARE: A Computational framework for Airborne Respiratory disease Evaluation integrating flow physics and human behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21782v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk of indoor airborne transmission among co-located individuals is generally non-uniform, which remains a critical challenge for public health modelling. Thus, we present CompARE, an integrated risk assessment framework for indoor airborne disease transmission that reveals a striking bimodal distribution of infection risk driven by airflow dynamics and human behavior. Combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), machine learning (ML), and agent-based modeling (ABM), our model captures the complex interplay between aerosol transport, human mobility, and environmental context. Based on a prototypical childcare center, our approach quantifies how incorporation of ABM can unveil significantly different infection risk profiles across agents, with more than two-fold change in risk of infection between the individuals with the lowest and highest risks in more than 90% of cases, despite all individuals being in the same overall environment. We found that infection risk distributions can exhibit not only a striking bimodal pattern in certain activities but also exponential decay and fat-tailed behavior in others. Specifically, we identify low-risk modes arising from source containment, as well as high-risk tails from prolonged close contact. Our approach enables near-real-time scenario analysis and provides policy-relevant quantitative insights into how ventilation design, spatial layout, and social distancing policies can mitigate transmission risk. These findings challenge simple distance-based heuristics and support the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions in high-occupancy indoor settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</p></details> |  |

The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations. We assess eleven architectures spanning neural operator methods (e.g., Fourier Neural Operator), geometric deep learning (PointNet, RegDGCNN, PointMAE, PointTransformer), transformer-based neural solvers (Transolver, Transolver++, AB-UPT), and implicit field networks (TripNet). Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty. To accelerate progress in data-driven engineering, we open-source the benchmark framework, including training pipelines, uncertainty estimation routines based on bootstrap resampling, and pretrained model weights, establishing the first reproducible foundation for large-scale learning from high-fidelity CFD simulations, available at https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/CarBench.</p></details> |  |

While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.</p></details> | 19 pages |

In contrast to standard regression models that require a prescribed functional form, SR constructs expressions from a user-defined set of mathematical primitives, enabling the automated discovery of compact formulas that fit the data and reveal underlying physical relationships. In fluid mechanics, where understanding the underlying physics is as crucial as predictive accuracy, this study applies SR to model three-dimensional (3D) laminar flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the axial velocity and pressure fields. Compact symbolic equations were derived from numerical simulation data, accurately reproducing the expected parabolic velocity profile and linear pressure drop, and showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions from the literature. To address the limitation that purely data-driven SR models may overlook domain-specific constraints, an innovative hybrid framework that integrates SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is also introduced. This integration combines the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning capabilities of ASP, ensuring that derived equations remain both statistically accurate and physically plausible. The proposed SR/ASP methodology demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-representation approaches to enhance interpretability, reliability, and alignment with physical principles in fluid dynamics and related domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |
| **[FunDiff: Diffusion Models over Function Spaces for Physics-Informed Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07902v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

| **[Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19390v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04898v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh-Quantization for Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18474v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDBench: Benchmarking Data-Driven Methods for Model Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20529v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomness as Reference: Benchmark Metric for Optimization in Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17226v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking optimization algorithms is fundamental for the advancement of computational intelligence. However, widely adopted artificial test suites exhibit limited correspondence with the diversity and complexity of real-world engineering optimization tasks. This paper presents a new benchmark suite comprising 231 bounded, continuous, unconstrained optimization problems, the majority derived from engineering design and simulation scenarios, including computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis models. In conjunction with this suite, a novel performance metric is introduced, which employs random sampling as a statistical reference, providing nonlinear normalization of objective values and enabling unbiased comparison of algorithmic efficiency across heterogeneous problems. Using this framework, 20 deterministic and stochastic optimization methods were systematically evaluated through hundreds of independent runs per problem, ensuring statistical robustness. The results indicate that only a few of the tested optimization methods consistently achieve excellent performance, while several commonly used metaheuristics exhibit severe efficiency loss on engineering-type problems, emphasizing the limitations of conventional benchmarks. Furthermore, the conducted tests are used for analyzing various features of the optimization methods, providing practical guidelines for their application. The proposed test suite and metric together offer a transparent, reproducible, and practically relevant platform for evaluating and comparing optimization methods, thereby narrowing the gap between the available benchmark tests and realistic engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Convex-Inspired Neural Construction for Structured and Generalizable Nonlinear Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18241v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time simulation of deformable objects relies on model reduction to achieve interactive performance while maintaining physical fidelity. Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions. We evaluate our method on challenging deformation scenarios involving forces of different magnitudes, inverse directions, and sparsely sampled training data. Our approach demonstrates superior generalization while maintaining compact reduced spaces, and supports real-time interactive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |

However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map. This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

A key challenge is that ensemble-based approaches can become prohibitively expensive when embedded in control and data assimilation loops in digital twins, even when reduced models are used. We introduce a reduced modeling approach that advances in time the mean and covariance of the reduced solution distribution induced by the initial condition uncertainties, which eliminates the need to maintain and propagate a costly ensemble of reduced solutions. The mean and covariance dynamics are obtained as a moment closure from Neural Galerkin schemes on pre-trained neural networks, which can be interpreted as filtered Neural Galerkin dynamics analogous to Gaussian filtering and the extended Kalman filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that filtered Neural Galerkin schemes achieve more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to ensemble-based uncertainty propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |

From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Updating of constitutive parameters under hybrid uncertainties with a novel surrogate model applied to biofilms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15145v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Speed: A Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Machine Learning Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12276v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.</p></details> |  |

Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Learning at Machine Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19980v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |

The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

| **[Learning Stochastic Multiscale Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22655v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly from observational data. Drawing inspiration from physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, we resolve the macroscale state on a coarse mesh while introducing a microscale latent state to explicitly model unresolved dynamics. We learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a simulator-free amortized variational inference method with a Product of Experts likelihood that enforces scale separation. We present detailed numerical studies to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to under-resolved direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at equivalent resolution, as well as reduced-order modeling approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |

Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Experiments were carried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under both irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, 1 box</p></details> |

However, their opaque inner workings often constitute an obstacle to physical interpretability. This work introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a novel FNO-based architecture tailored for reduced-order modeling of turbulent fluid flows, designed to enhance interpretability by explicitly separating fluid behavior across scales. The proposed architecture processes wavenumber bins in parallel, enabling the approximation of dispersion relations and non-linear interactions. Inputs are lifted to a higher-dimensional space, Fourier-transformed, and partitioned into wavenumber bins. Each bin is processed by a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), with outputs subsequently padded, summed, and inverse-transformed back into physical space. A final transformation refines the output in physical space as a correction model, by means of one of the following architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Echo State Network (ESN). We evaluate the proposed model on a series of increasingly complex dynamical systems: first on the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, then on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and finally on the prediction of wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow, given the near-wall velocity field. In all test cases, the model demonstrates its ability to decompose turbulent flows across various scales, opening up the possibility of increased interpretability and multiscale modeling of such flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Simulations of nonlinear structures, such as soft-bodied robots modeled using the finite element method (FEM), often demand substantial computational resources, especially during optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel optimization algorithm based on a tensorial parametric reduced order model (PROM). Our algorithm leverages dimensionality reduction and solution approximation techniques to facilitate efficient solving of nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The well-structured tensorial approach enables the use of analytical gradients within a specifically chosen reduced order basis (ROB), significantly enhancing computational efficiency. To showcase the performance of our method, we apply it to optimizing soft robotic swimmer shapes. These actuated soft robots experience hydrodynamic forces, subjecting them to both internal and external nonlinear forces, which are incorporated into our optimization process using a data-free ROB for fast and accurate computations. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also unlocks new opportunities to optimize complex nonlinear systems in soft robotics, paving the way for more efficient design and control.</p></details> |  |

Unlike data-driven approaches, this method operates directly on the governing equations, eliminating the need for full-order simulations. The proposed model is computed at a single value of the bifurcation parameter yet remains valid over a range of values. The approach systematically constructs an invariant manifold and embedded dynamics, providing an accurate and efficient reduction of the original system. The ability to capture pre-critical steady states, the bifurcation point, and post-critical limit cycle oscillations is demonstrated by a strong agreement between the reduced order model and full order simulations, while achieving significant computational speed-up.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Reduced Order Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs via Differentiable Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14595v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics. Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($Φ$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $Φ$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across various PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation that is readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers, available at https://phi-rom.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p></details> |  |

Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

We utilize this framework to parameterize the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile phase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation analytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate synthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary conditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of advection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of required forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a reduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the advection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the synthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by Projected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against several alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global random optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using nearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to 295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers accurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers to link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics, and measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the analysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional forward simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Water Resources Research</p></details> |

To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regul...</summary><p>Regular research article, 28 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |

In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |

Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |

Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, associated code available at https://github.com/herluc/statROM.

In essence, it quantifies the similarity across densities of the clusters, which are defined by a given labeling. This labeling may originate from a geometric partitioning of the state space itself, but need not in general. We illustrate its performance on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark data set, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the BSI provides a coherent assessment in cases where traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in the resource-allocation setting where equal density may be associated with a "fair" distribution, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects inequality with high sensitivity, but also offers a numerically smooth measure that can be easily embedded in optimization frameworks as a regularization term for modern policy-making. Finally, the BSI also offers a new measure of the effectiveness for a given symbolic representation, i.e. coarse-grain states, for continuous-valued data recorded from complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-parametric Causal Inference in Dynamic Thresholding Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15244v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider a setting where we regularly monitor patients' fasting blood sugar, and declare them to have prediabetes (and encourage preventative care) if this number crosses a pre-specified threshold. The sharp, threshold-based treatment policy suggests that we should be able to estimate the long-term benefit of this preventative care by comparing the health trajectories of patients with blood sugar measurements right above and below the threshold. A naive regression-discontinuity analysis, however, is not applicable here, as it ignores the temporal dynamics of the problem where, e.g., a patient just below the threshold on one visit may become prediabetic (and receive treatment) following their next visit. Here, we study thresholding designs in general dynamic systems, and show that simple reduced-form characterizations remain available for a relevant causal target, namely a dynamic marginal policy effect at the treatment threshold. We develop a local-linear-regression approach for estimation and inference of this estimand, and demonstrate promise of our approach in numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Many Heads Make an SSM? A Unified Framework for Attention and State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15115v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense Associative Memories with Analog Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15002v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of modern AI systems have exposed fundamental limitations of digital hardware, driving interest in alternative paradigms for efficient large-scale inference. Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. By harnessing the intrinsic parallelism and continuous-time operation of analog circuits, our DenseAM-based accelerator design offers a new avenue for fast and scalable AI hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Physical Basis for Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09567v6)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What is information, physically, and why does it so reliably emerge in living, cultural, and technological systems? Existing theories quantify uncertainty, cost, or compressibility, but do not identify which physical structures count as information or how informational entities arise from dynamics. Here we introduce a causal-physical framework that defines information as a heritable causal role played by persistent (metastable) structures in a dynamical system. We represent long-lived structures as almost-invariant sets and assemble them into causal structure sets that encode how such structures generate, transform, and maintain one another. Within this representation, informational entities are singled out by three generative motifs: replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates, which together define when a collection of structures constitutes an information family. We demonstrate the full pipeline by mapping a concrete cultural episode (fruit-salad recipe sharing and modification) into a causal structure set, and show how the motifs and information families can then be identified algorithmically. The framework yields computable quantities, including informational fitness and informational entropy, directly from causal structure, enabling informational variants to be detected, compared, and tracked across biological, cultural, engineered, and digital domains. Finally, motivated by analogies to random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we propose testable conditions under which hereditary informational motifs become statistically generic in sufficiently large causal-physical systems.</p></details> | - |
| **[From STLS to Projection-based Dictionary Selection in Sparse Regression for System Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14404v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we revisit dictionary-based sparse regression, in particular, Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS), and propose a score-guided library selection to provide practical guidance for data-driven modeling, with emphasis on SINDy-type algorithms. STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.</p></details> | 34 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at AAAI 2026 Conference</p></details> |
| **[CiRL: Open-Source Environments for Reinforcement Learning in Circular Economy and Net Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21536v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity control of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control design; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is intended to be a tool to generate AI-driven actions for optimizing the circularity of supply-recovery chains and to be combined with human-driven decisions derived from material flow analysis (MFA) studies. CiRL is publicly available.</p></details> | To be submitted |
| **[Fully Bayesian Differential Gaussian Processes through Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06069v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Gaussian process models typically employ discrete hierarchies, but recent advancements in differential Gaussian processes (DiffGPs) have extended these models to infinite depths. However, existing DiffGP approaches often overlook the uncertainty in kernel hyperparameters by treating them as fixed and time-invariant, which degrades the model's predictive performance and neglects the posterior distribution. In this work, we introduce a fully Bayesian framework that models kernel hyperparameters as random variables and utilizes coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to jointly learn their posterior distributions alongside those of inducing points. By incorporating the estimation uncertainty of hyperparameters, our method significantly enhances model flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamic systems. Furthermore, we employ a black-box adaptive SDE solver with a neural network to achieve realistic, time varying posterior approximations, thereby improving the expressiveness of the variational posterior. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other key performance metrics. This work not only provides a robust Bayesian extension to DiffGP models but also validates its effectiveness in handling intricate dynamic behaviors, thereby advancing the applicability of Gaussian process models in diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised learning of multiscale switching dynamical system models from multimodal neural data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12881v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural population activity often exhibits regime-dependent non-stationarity in the form of switching dynamics. Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From Linear Risk to Emergent Harm: Complexity as the Missing Core of AI Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12707v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk-based AI regulation has become the dominant paradigm in AI governance, promising proportional controls aligned with anticipated harms. This paper argues that such frameworks often fail for structural reasons: they implicitly assume linear causality, stable system boundaries, and largely predictable responses to regulation. In practice, AI operates within complex adaptive socio-technical systems in which harm is frequently emergent, delayed, redistributed, and amplified through feedback loops and strategic adaptation by system actors. As a result, compliance can increase while harm is displaced or concealed rather than eliminated. We propose a complexity-based framework for AI governance that treats regulation as intervention rather than control, prioritises dynamic system mapping over static classifications, and integrates causal reasoning and simulation for policy design under uncertainty. The aim is not to eliminate uncertainty, but to enable robust system stewardship through monitoring, learning, and iterative revision of governance interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>White...</summary><p>White Paper / Policy Brief (Working Paper).

We introduce Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), a numerically stable, fully parallelism and generalized formulation of the delta rule. Specifically, we formulate the online learning update as a continuous-time dynamical system and prove that its exact solution is not only attainable but also computable in linear time with full parallelism. By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order Runge-Kutta method. This attention mechanism is theoretically free from error accumulation, perfectly capturing the continuous dynamics while preserving the linear-time complexity. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that EFLA enables robust performance in noisy environments, achieving lower language modeling perplexity and superior downstream benchmark performance than DeltaNet without introducing additional parameters. Our work provides a new theoretical foundation for building high-fidelity, scalable linear-time attention models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |

Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise.</p></details> | under revision |

Here we study overprovisioned architectures combined with sparsification to learn compact, interpretable KANs without sacrificing accuracy. Crucially, we focus on differentiable sparsification, turning architecture search into an end-to-end optimization problem. Across function approximation benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, we demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy while discovering substantially smaller models. Overprovisioning and sparsification are synergistic, with the combination outperforming either alone. The result is a principled path toward models that are both more expressive and more interpretable, addressing a key tension in scientific machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven modelling of autonomous and forced dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12432v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper demonstrates that invariant foliations are accurate, data-efficient and practical tools for data-driven modelling of physical systems. Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations. To interpret the results, the identified mathematical models are transformed to a canonical form and instantaneous frequency and damping information are calculated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Invariant foliation, Invariant manifold, Reduced order model, Instantaneous frequency, Tensor approximation, Machine learning, JEPA</p></details> |
| **[Neural CDEs as Correctors for Learned Time Series Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12116v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned time-series models, whether continuous- or discrete-time, are widely used to forecast the states of a dynamical system. Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone.</p></details> |  |

Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |

Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted for publication in the main track of AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Evolve with Convergence Guarantee via Neural Unrolling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11453v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition from hand-crafted heuristics to data-driven evolutionary algorithms faces a fundamental dilemma: achieving neural plasticity without sacrificing mathematical stability. Emerging learned optimizers demonstrate high adaptability. However, they often lack rigorous convergence guarantees. This deficiency results in unpredictable behaviors on unseen landscapes. To address this challenge, we introduce Learning to Evolve (L2E), a unified bilevel meta-optimization framework. This method reformulates evolutionary search as a Neural Unrolling process grounded in Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) fixed-point theory. First, L2E models a coupled dynamic system in which the inner loop enforces a strict contractive trajectory via a structured Mamba-based neural operator. Second, the outer loop optimizes meta-parameters to align the fixed point of the operator with the target objective minimizers. Third, we design a gradient-derived composite solver that adaptively fuses learned evolutionary proposals with proxy gradient steps, thereby harmonizing global exploration with local refinement. Crucially, this formulation provides the learned optimizer with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability of L2E in high-dimensional spaces and its robust zero-shot generalization across synthetic and real-world control tasks. These results confirm that the framework learns a generic optimization manifold that extends beyond specific training distributions.</p></details> |  |

We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages. v2: minor corrections. v3: minor improvements and references added.

| **[ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

This work presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided. To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the complexity of trajectory evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we modify SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) embedded with symbolic regression for the temporal encoding, circumventing auto-regressive long-term forecasting for physical data. This is achieved through a new sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to impose sparsity regularization on the latent space, which also allows for immediate symbolic interpretation. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |
| **[On a class of constrained Bayesian filters and their numerical implementation in high-dimensional state-space Markov models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11012v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian filtering is a key tool in many problems that involve the online processing of data, including data assimilation, optimal control, nonlinear tracking and others. Unfortunately, the implementation of filters for nonlinear, possibly high-dimensional, dynamical systems is far from straightforward, as computational methods have to meet a delicate trade-off involving stability, accuracy and computational cost. In this paper we investigate the design, and theoretical features, of constrained Bayesian filters for state space models. The constraint on the filter is given by a sequence of compact subsets of the state space that determines the sources and targets of the Markov transition kernels in the dynamical model. Subject to such constraints, we provide sufficient conditions for filter stability and approximation error rates with respect to the original (unconstrained) Bayesian filter. Then, we look specifically into the implementation of constrained filters in a continuous-discrete setting where the state of the system is a continuous-time stochastic Itô process but data are collected sequentially over a time grid. We propose an implementation of the constraint that relies on a data-driven modification of the drift of the Itô process using barrier functions, and discuss the relation of this scheme with methods based on the Doob $h$-transform. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed methods in computer experiments for a partially-observed stochastic Lorenz 96 model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Analysis of Generalized Langevin Equations with Approximated Memory Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10256v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze prediction error in stochastic dynamical systems with memory, focusing on generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) formulated as stochastic Volterra equations. We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Next-Generation Reservoir Computing for Dynamical Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11338v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) for modeling dynamical systems from time-series data. The method uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded inputs, allowing the feature-space dimension to be chosen independently of the observation size and offering a flexible alternative to polynomial-based NGRC projections. We demonstrate the approach on benchmark tasks, including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation, using partial and noisy measurements. We further show that small amounts of measurement noise during training act as an effective regularizer, improving long-term autonomous stability compared to standard regression alone. Across all tests, the models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond the training data. The framework offers explicit control of system state during prediction, and these properties make NGRC a natural candidate for applications such as surrogate modeling and digital-twin applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures; revision</p></details> |
| **[Lazy Diffusion: Mitigating spectral collapse in generative diffusion-based stable autoregressive emulation of turbulent flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09572v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-λ}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $β(τ)\!\propto\!τ^γ$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that naïve Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309v4)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive non-stationary implicit process prior that can capture complex transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (16 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Polynomiogram: An Integrated Framework for Root Visualization and Generative Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04263v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents the Polynomiogram framework, an integrated computational platform for exploring, visualizing, and generating art from polynomial root systems. The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet is a good candidate to tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to bad behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 36 figures.

We first extend a stability proof method of Borkar and Meyn to accommodate more general noise conditions than previously considered, thereby yielding broader convergence guarantees for asynchronous SA. To sharpen the convergence analysis, we further examine the shadowing properties of asynchronous SA, building on a dynamical systems approach of Hirsch and Benaïm. These results provide a theoretical foundation for a class of relative value iteration-based reinforcement learning algorithms -- developed and analyzed in a companion paper -- for solving average-reward Markov and semi-Markov decision processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages.

In essence, it quantifies the similarity across densities of the clusters, which are defined by a given labeling. This labeling may originate from a geometric partitioning of the state space itself, but need not in general. We illustrate its performance on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark data set, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the BSI provides a coherent assessment in cases where traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in the resource-allocation setting where equal density may be associated with a "fair" distribution, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects inequality with high sensitivity, but also offers a numerically smooth measure that can be easily embedded in optimization frameworks as a regularization term for modern policy-making. Finally, the BSI also offers a new measure of the effectiveness for a given symbolic representation, i.e. coarse-grain states, for continuous-valued data recorded from complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
