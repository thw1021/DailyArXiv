| **[PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16992v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code at https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT</p></details> |
| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a machine learning framework for modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose behavior can, in principle, be described by PDEs but lack explicit models. The method extends the Equation-Free approach, enabling the data-driven reconstruction of reduced-order models (ROMs) without needing to identify governing equations. Using manifold learning, we obtain a latent space representation of system evolution from data via delayed coordinates, in accordance with Takens/Whitney's embedding theorems. Linear (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, POD) and nonlinear (Diffusion Maps, DMs) methods are employed to extract low-dimensional embeddings that capture the essential dynamics. Predictive ROMs are then learned within this latent space, and their evolution is lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We show that both POD and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) lifting operators preserve mass, a key physical constraint in systems such as computational fluid dynamics and crowd dynamics. Our framework effectively reconstructs the solution operator of the underlying PDE without discovering the PDE itself, by leveraging a manifold-informed objective map that bridges multiple scales. For our illustrations, we use synthetic spatio-temporal data from the Hughes model, which couples a continuity PDE with an Eikonal equation describing optimal path selection in crowds. Results show that DM-based nonlinear embeddings outperform POD in reconstruction accuracy, producing more parsimonious and stable ROMs that remain accurate and integrable over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unconditionally Stable, Variable Step DLN Methods for the Allen-Cahn Active Fluid Model: A Divergence-free Preserving Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16860v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the divergence-free mixed finite element method (FEM) for nonlinear fourth-order Allen-Cahn phase field coupled active fluid equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$, the original fourth-order problem is converted into a system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-comforming finite element spaces. To further refine the formulation, an additional auxiliary variable $\xi$, analogous to the pressure, is introduced, resulting in a mixed finite element scheme that preserves the divergence-free condition in $which = \Delta u$ inherited from the model. A fully discrete scheme is then established by combining the spatial approximation by the divergence-free mixed finite element method with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme is rigorously derived under suitable regularity assumptions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on the minimum dissipation criterion is carried out to enhance computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrivAerStar: An Industrial-Grade CFD Dataset for Vehicle Aerodynamic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16857v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16399v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AB-UPT for Automotive and Aerospace Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15808v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) shows strong capabilities to replicate automotive computational fluid dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both datasets were generated with the Luminary Cloud platform containing automotives (SHIFT-SUV) and aircrafts (SHIFT-Wing). We start by detailing the data generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model. AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near perfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a simple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a day on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNO: Multiscale Neural Operator for Computational Fluid Dynamics with 3D Point Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16071v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Clifford-Steerable CNNs with Complete Kernel Basis for PDE Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our method consistently outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Property Testing for Ocean Models. Can We Specify It? (Invited Talk)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13692v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I take inspiration from the property-testing literature, particularly the work of Prof. John Hughes, and explore how such ideas might be applied to numerical models of the ocean. Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address the oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a number of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These examples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying property tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and useful, remains to be seen.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings VSS 2025, arXiv:2510.12314</p></details> |
| **[Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Prior for First Order Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20278v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design optimization aims to infer system parameters from observed solutions, posing critical challenges across domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, structural engineering, materials science, and fluid dynamics. The lack of explicit mathematical representations in many systems complicates this process and makes the first order optimization impossible. Mainstream approaches, including generative AI and Bayesian optimization, address these challenges but have limitations. Generative AI is computationally expensive, while Bayesian optimization, relying on surrogate models, suffers from scalability, sensitivity to priors, and noise issues, often leading to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces Deep Physics Prior (DPP), a novel method enabling first-order gradient-based inverse optimization with surrogate machine learning models. By leveraging pretrained auxiliary Neural Operators, DPP enforces prior distribution constraints to ensure robust and meaningful solutions. This approach is particularly effective when prior data and observation distributions are unknown.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Constrained Sensing and Reliable State Estimation with Shallow Recurrent Decoders on a TRIGA Mark II Reactor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12368v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel data-driven methodology able to provide accurate state estimation in engineering systems, such as nuclear reactors. This deep learning architecture is a robust technique designed to map the temporal trajectories of a few sparse measures to the full state space, including unobservable fields, which is agnostic to sensor positions and able to handle noisy data through an ensemble strategy, leveraging the short training times and without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Following its application to a novel reactor concept, this work investigates the performance of Shallow Recurrent Decoders when applied to a real system. The underlying model is represented by a fluid dynamics model of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor; the architecture will use both synthetic temperature data coming from the numerical model and leveraging experimental temperature data recorded during a previous campaign. The objective of this work is, therefore, two-fold: 1) assessing if the architecture can reconstruct the full state of the system (temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulence quantities) given sparse data located in specific, low-dynamics channels and 2) assessing the correction capabilities of the architecture (that is, given a discrepancy between model and data, assessing if sparse measurements can provide some correction to the architecture output). As will be shown, the accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field, using both synthetic and experimental data, in real-time makes this approach suitable for interpretable monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</p></details> | 40 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Blade: A Derivative-free Bayesian Inversion Method using Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10968v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase-separated lipid vesicles: continuum modeling, simulation, and validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15201v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper presents a complete research cycle comprising continuum-based modeling, computational framework development, and validation setup to predict phase separation and surface hydrodynamics in lipid bilayer membranes. We starting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid bilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and thermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers. The most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system, describing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with phase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using trace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability in representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine physical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The computational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against experimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors, demonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics is essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in epi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate external forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic lipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comprehensive comparison of neural operators for 3D industry-scale engineering designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05995v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces, enabling real-time prediction of complex dynamics in diverse scientific and engineering applications. With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems.

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers high-fidelity predictions, its computational cost limits its use in iterative design. Equivalent Mechanical Models (EMMs) provide a faster alternative, though their predictive performance, especially in closed-loop scenarios, remains largely unexplored. This work presents a comparative analysis of a spacecraft under feedback control, using both CFD and a reduced-order sloshing model. Results show good agreement, validating the simplified model for the manoeuvrer considered. This validation enables efficient sensitivity and stability studies, offering a practical tool for early-stage spacecraft design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications.

The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Performance of a high-order MPI-Kokkos accelerated fluid solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05254v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work discusses the performance of a modern numerical scheme for fluid dynamical problems on modern high-performance computing architectures. Our code implements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an order of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta methods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations as well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In order to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units and accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in conjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on various GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code. Eighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing time than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller impact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to generally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs. The many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed up to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size simulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over CPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\approx 3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical simulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large grid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency that the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use it efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need longer computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the energy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 16 figures. submitted to Computer Physics Communications</p></details> |
| **[FoilDiff: A Hybrid Transformer Backbone for Diffusion-based Modelling of 2D Airfoil Flow Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04325v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03699v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Neural-operator Predictive Control for Drag Reduction in Turbulent Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03360v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing turbulence control effects for wall friction numerically is a significant challenge since it requires expensive simulations of turbulent fluid dynamics. We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition. Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</p></details> |  |

This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

This process can be arduous, requiring extensive resources, time, and detailed knowledge of the existing system. ROSplane is a lean, open-source fixed-wing autonomy stack built by researchers for researchers. It is designed to accelerate research by providing clearly defined interfaces with an easily modifiable framework. Powered by ROS 2, ROSplane allows for rapid integration of low or high-level control, path planning, or estimation algorithms. A focus on lean, easily understood code and extensive documentation lowers the barrier to entry for researchers. Recent developments to ROSplane improve its capacity to accelerate UAV research, including the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, enhanced estimation and control algorithms, increased modularity, and an improved aerodynamic modeling pipeline. This aerodynamic modeling pipeline significantly reduces the effort of transitioning from simulation to real-world testing without requiring expensive system identification or computational fluid dynamics tools. ROSplane's architecture reduces the effort required to integrate new research tools and methods, expediting hardware experimentation.</p></details> |  |

And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing.

However, current studies primarily focus on natural image restoration, leaving the performance of these algorithms in scientific inverse problems largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{InverseBench}, a framework that evaluates diffusion models across five distinct scientific inverse problems. These problems present unique structural challenges that differ from existing benchmarks, arising from critical scientific applications such as optical tomography, medical imaging, black hole imaging, seismology, and fluid dynamics. With \textsc{InverseBench}, we benchmark 14 inverse problem algorithms that use plug-and-play diffusion priors against strong, domain-specific baselines, offering valuable new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms. To facilitate further research and development, we open-source the codebase, along with datasets and pre-trained models, at https://devzhk.github.io/InverseBench/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffuse Domain Methods with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25115v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains often presents a significant computational challenge by requiring the generation of fitted meshes. The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative which reformulates the problem on a larger, simple domain where the complex geometry is represented by a smooth phase-field function. This paper introduces and analyses several new DDM methods for solving problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We derive two new methods from the mixed formulation of the governing equations. This approach transforms the essential Dirichlet conditions into natural boundary conditions. Additionally, we develop coercive formulations based on Nitsche's method, and provide proofs of coercivity for all new and key existing approximations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved accuracy of the new methods, and reveal the balance between $L^2$ and $H^1$ errors. The practical effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a benchmark fluid dynamics problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Certificate of Trust: Task-Aware OOD Detection for Scientific AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25080v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based scientific predictions.

| **[Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24573v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.</p></details> |  |

However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application.

| **[Reversible GNS for Dissipative Fluids with Consistent Bidirectional Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22207v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ChaosNexus: A Foundation Model for Universal Chaotic System Forecasting with Multi-scale Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21802v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures, 4 appendicies</p></details> |

The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.</p></details> | 41 pages, 24 figures |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The first-order optimality condition for a state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space reduction.</p></details> | 25 pages |

| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a machine learning framework for modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose behavior can, in principle, be described by PDEs but lack explicit models. The method extends the Equation-Free approach, enabling the data-driven reconstruction of reduced-order models (ROMs) without needing to identify governing equations. Using manifold learning, we obtain a latent space representation of system evolution from data via delayed coordinates, in accordance with Takens/Whitney's embedding theorems. Linear (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, POD) and nonlinear (Diffusion Maps, DMs) methods are employed to extract low-dimensional embeddings that capture the essential dynamics. Predictive ROMs are then learned within this latent space, and their evolution is lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We show that both POD and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) lifting operators preserve mass, a key physical constraint in systems such as computational fluid dynamics and crowd dynamics. Our framework effectively reconstructs the solution operator of the underlying PDE without discovering the PDE itself, by leveraging a manifold-informed objective map that bridges multiple scales. For our illustrations, we use synthetic spatio-temporal data from the Hughes model, which couples a continuity PDE with an Eikonal equation describing optimal path selection in crowds. Results show that DM-based nonlinear embeddings outperform POD in reconstruction accuracy, producing more parsimonious and stable ROMs that remain accurate and integrable over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields. We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving performance estimation of a PCM-integrated solar chimney through reduced-order based data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16469v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM) integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and 203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing Low-Dimensional Structure in 2D Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities via Parametric Reduced-Order Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16197v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning-Based Ultrasonic Weld Characterization Using Hierarchical Wave Modeling and Diffusion-Driven Distribution Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13023v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings (resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Partial Differential Equations on Parameter-Dependent Domains Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17171v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or the solution of the equations over multiple parameters. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, reduced order models (ROMs) are built using a set of precomputed solutions (snapshots) corresponding to different parameter values. Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM, offering improved flexibility and performance. In many cases, the domain on which the PDE is defined also varies. Capturing this variation is important for building accurate ROMs but is often difficult, especially when the domain has a complex structure or changes topology. In this paper, we propose a Deep-ROM framework that can automatically extract useful domain parametrization and incorporate it into the model. Unlike traditional domain parameterization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. It can also learn from domain data even when no mesh is available. Using deep autoencoders, our approach reduces the dimensionality of both the PDE solution and the domain representation, making it possible to approximate solutions efficiently across a wide range of domain shapes and parameter values. We demonstrate that our approach produces parametrizations that yield solution accuracy comparable to models using exact parameters. Importantly, our model remains stable under moderate geometric variations in the domain, such as boundary deformations and noise - scenarios where traditional ROMs often require remeshing or manual adjustment.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Statistical reduced order modelling for the parametric Helmholtz equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04438v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, associated code available at https://github.com/herluc/statROM.

| **[Fast Subspace Fluid Simulation with a Temporally-Aware Basis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05339v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, memory-efficient, and user-controllable subspace simulation. We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.</p></details> |  |

In the context of damage detection, parametric reduced order models (ROMs) are well suited for fast computations by establishing an efficient offline/online split of the simulation process. The problems of interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and efficient reduction with low online cost. We demonstrate the applicability of the ROM approach with benchmark tests on linear elastic problems discretized with splines and the extended isogeometric method (XIGA) for crack modelling. The results we obtain show the accuracy and real-time efficiency of the constructed reduced order models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference taking place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in May 2026</p></details> |

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport. GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, First authors contributed equally</p></details> |

This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p></details> |  |

Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the topology optimization of structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures.

This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics. To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation, demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code https://github.com/dcherenson/adaptive-control-underactuated</p></details> |

In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold, derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence Rates for Gradient Descent on the Edge of Stability in Overparametrised Least Squares](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17506v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime. In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima. In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c) the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat global minimum.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2025.

However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |

In this chapter we show how state-dependent delays arise naturally when modeling and the consequences that follow. We treat discrete state-dependent delays, and delays implicitly defined by threshold conditions. We will consider modeling, formulation as dynamical systems, linearization, and numerical techniques. For discrete state-dependent delays we show how breaking points can be tracked efficiently to preserve the order of numerical methods for simulating solutions. For threshold conditions we will discuss how a velocity ratio term arises in models, and present a heuristic linearization method that avoids Banach spaces and sun-star calculus, making the method accessible to a wider audience. We will also discuss numerical implementations of threshold and distributed delay problems which allows them to be treated numerically with standard software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on presentations at "Delays and Structures in Dynamical Systems: Modeling, Analysis and Numerical Methods" at the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences (CISM) in November 2023 in Udine</p></details> |

Event cameras offer high-speed, low-light sensing, but existing approaches fail to recover vibration amplitude and frequency with sufficient accuracy. We present an event topology-based visual microphone that reconstructs vibrations directly from raw event streams without external illumination. By integrating the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis with hierarchical density-based clustering, our framework captures the intrinsic structure of event data to recover both amplitude and frequency with high fidelity. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over prior methods and enable simultaneous recovery of multiple sound sources from a single event stream, advancing the frontier of passive, illumination-free vibration sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Noise-Aware System Identification for High-Dimensional Stochastic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00002v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic dynamical systems are ubiquitous in physics, biology, and engineering, where both deterministic drifts and random fluctuations govern system behavior. Learning these dynamics from data is particularly challenging in high-dimensional settings with complex, correlated, or state-dependent noise. We introduce a noise-aware system identification framework that jointly recovers the deterministic drift and full noise structure directly from the trajectory data, without requiring prior assumptions on the noise model. Our method accommodates a broad class of stochastic dynamics, including colored and multiplicative noise, that scales efficiently to high-dimensional systems, and accurately reconstructs the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments on diverse systems validate the approach and highlight its potential for data-driven modeling in complex stochastic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.02595</p></details> |
| **[Neuronal Group Communication for Efficient Neural representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16851v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 2 figures |

By representing product locations and order flows within a time-evolving graph structure, we employ unsupervised clustering to define and refine compact order regions, effectively reducing picking distances. We describe the procedure using a dynamic mathematical model formulated using tools from random dynamical systems theory, enabling a principled analysis of the system's behavior over time even under random operational variations. For routing within this framework, we implement a parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm, utilizing GPU acceleration to evaluate path segments efficiently. To address scalability challenges inherent in large routing graphs, we introduce a segmentation strategy that preserves performance while maintaining tractable memory requirements. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both operational efficiency and computational feasibility for large-scale warehouse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

| **[A Volumetric Privacy Measure for Dynamical Systems With Bounded Disturbance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02893v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a volumetric privacy framework for dynamical systems subject to bounded disturbances, developed without requiring prior knowledge of their probability distributions. We consider systems with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. An adversary is assumed to execute an inference attack by exploiting the observed public state set to estimate an uncertainty set for the private state. The volume of this inferred set quantifies the adversary's estimation uncertainty and serves as the proposed volumetric privacy metric. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that it is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the volumetric privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we show that a selection principle from the theory of differential inclusions transforms the dual lasso problem into the problem of calculating the trajectory of a projected dynamical system that we prove is integrable. Our analysis yields an exact algorithm for the lasso problem, numerically up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and is very fast. Moreover, we show the continuation of solutions to the integrable projected dynamical system in terms of the hyperparameter naturally yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in both efficiency and accuracy. Beyond this work, we expect our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 2 figures, submitted</p></details> |
| **[Simulation-free Structure Learning for Stochastic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16656v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics -- a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.</p></details> |  |

At each discrete-time step, the players can take over or retain control, incurring state and control-dependent costs. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, with a discrete \texttt{FlipDyn} state determining control authority. Our contributions are: (i) For arbitrary non-negative costs, we derive the saddle-point value of the \texttt{FlipDyn} game and the corresponding Nash equilibria (NE) takeover strategies. (ii) For linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we establish sufficient conditions under which the game admits an NE. (iii) For scalar linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive parameterized NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state. (iv) For higher-dimensional linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive approximate NE takeover strategies and control policies, and compute bounds on the saddle-point values. We validate our results through a numerical study on adversarial control of a linear system.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 2 figures.

| **[Physics-Informed Deep B-Spline Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16777v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning offers a promising framework for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating observational data with governing physical laws. However, learning PDEs with varying parameters and changing initial conditions and boundary conditions (ICBCs) with theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose physics-informed deep B-spline networks, a novel technique that approximates a family of PDEs with different parameters and ICBCs by learning B-spline control points through neural networks. The proposed B-spline representation reduces the learning task from predicting solution values over the entire domain to learning a compact set of control points, enforces strict compliance to initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions by construction, and enables analytical computation of derivatives for incorporating PDE residual losses. While existing approximation and generalization theories are not applicable in this setting - where solutions of parametrized PDE families are represented via B-spline bases - we fill this gap by showing that B-spline networks are universal approximators for such families under mild conditions. We also derive generalization error bounds for physics-informed learning in both elliptic and parabolic PDE settings, establishing new theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate in experiments that the proposed technique has improved efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs compared to existing techniques in a dynamical system problem with discontinuous ICBCs and can handle nonhomogeneous ICBCs and non-rectangular domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Targeting in Dynamic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00312v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern treatment targeting methods often rely on estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using machine learning tools. While effective in identifying who benefits from treatment on the individual level, these approaches typically overlook system-level dynamics that may arise when treatments induce strain on shared capacity. We study the problem of targeting in Markovian systems, where treatment decisions must be made one at a time as units arrive, and early decisions can impact later outcomes through delayed or limited access to resources. We show that optimal policies in such settings compare CATE-like quantities to state-specific thresholds, where each threshold reflects the expected cumulative impact on the system of treating an additional individual in the given state. We propose an algorithm that augments standard CATE estimation with off-policy evaluation techniques to estimate these thresholds from observational data. Theoretical results establish consistency and convergence guarantees, and empirical studies demonstrate that our method improves long-run outcomes considerably relative to individual-level CATE targeting rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing Low-Dimensional Structure in 2D Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities via Parametric Reduced-Order Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16197v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |

Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Two Roads to Koopman Operator Theory for Control: Infinite Input Sequences and Operator Families](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15166v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator, originally defined for dynamical systems without input, has inspired many applications in control. Yet, the theoretical foundations underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories. Our analysis provides constructive tools to translate between the frameworks, offering a unified perspective for Koopman methods in control.</p></details> |  |

Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</p></details> |  |

Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these approaches which are typically used offline for analysis of system models designed with classical floating point procedures, interval and set-based methods have also been developed in recent years, which allow to directly solve the associated design tasks and to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online, i.e., during system operation. The latter approaches include set-based model predictive control, online parameter adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have been employed successfully.</p></details> |  |

We present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages + Appendix; Accepted to 6th International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI 2025)</p></details> |

Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences, thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling (including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences. Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$ less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.</p></details> |  |

We formulate the parameter estimation as a Bayesian inverse problem. We consider a parametrized system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is the FitzHugh--Nagumo model. The considered problem exhibits significant mathematical and computational challenges for classical parameter estimation methods, including strong nonlinearities, nonconvexity, and sharp gradients. We explore how NNs overcome these challenges by approximating reconstruction maps for parameter estimation from observational data. The considered data are time series of the spiking membrane potential of a biological neuron. We infer parameters controlling the dynamics of the model, noise parameters of autocorrelated additive noise, and noise modeled via stochastic differential equations, as well as the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution to expose parameter uncertainties--all with just one forward evaluation of an appropriate NN. We report results for different NN architectures and study the influence of noise on prediction accuracy. We also report timing results for training NNs on dedicated hardware. Our results demonstrate that NNs are a versatile tool to estimate parameters of the dynamical system, stochastic processes, as well as uncertainties, as they propagate through the governing ODE.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 16 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |

With DNNs characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer, termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies, game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.</p></details> |  |

However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware, multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical constraints and geometric prior.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

The algorithm accounts for the approximation errors due to the learning directly at the synthesis stage, ensuring recursive feasibility by construction. The optimal control problem consists of a linear noisy dynamical system, a quadratic stage and quadratic terminal costs as the objective, and convex constraints on the state, control, and disturbance sequences; the control minimizes and the disturbance maximizes the objective. We proceed via two steps -- (a) Data generation: First, we reformulate the given minmax problem into a convex semi-infinite program and employ recently developed tools to solve it in an exact fashion on grid points of the state space to generate (state, action) data. (b) Learning approximate feedback maps: We employ a couple of approximation schemes that furnish tight approximations within preassigned uniform error bounds on the admissible state space to learn the unknown feedback policy. The stability of the closed-loop system under the approximate feedback policies is also guaranteed under a standard set of hypotheses. Two benchmark numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.</p></details> | 27 pages; submitted |

In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).</p></details> |  |
| **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, which falters in long-horizon tasks where history is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguity. This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Information Shapes Koopman Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods.

| **[Towards Foundation Inference Models that Learn ODEs In-Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12650v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging, especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Runtime Composition in Dynamic System of Systems: A Systematic Review of Challenges, Solutions, Tools, and Evaluation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12616v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Modern Systems of Systems (SoSs) increasingly operate in dynamic environments (e.g., smart cities, autonomous vehicles) where runtime composition -- the on-the-fly discovery, integration, and coordination of constituent systems (CSs)--is crucial for adaptability. Despite growing interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas: co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks, adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience. Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling, while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools, limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based, implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation. Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically composable SoSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09059v6)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SBs between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SBs, and various other examples. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/georgeRapa/GMMflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>NIPS ...</summary><p>NIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Dual Perspectives on Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01028v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The {\em stop gradient} and {\em exponential moving average} iterative procedures are commonly used in non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream applications in practice. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We show that, in general, although they {\em do not} optimize the original objective, or {\em any} other smooth function, they {\em do} avoid collapse Following~\citet{Tian21}, but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average {\em always} leads to collapse. Conversely, we characterize explicitly the equilibria of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures in this linear setting as algebraic varieties in their parameter space, and show that they are, in general, {\em asymptotically stable}. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by empirical experiments with real and synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity-based Control of Power Converters: Simulation and Experimental Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18719v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size? In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks. Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Panda: A pretrained forecast model for chaotic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13755v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear Dynamics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen chaotic systems preserving both short-term accuracy and long-term statistics. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We also demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Field Theory: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p=(X_p,S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K)={E\in U \mid S(E,K)\ge \alpha}$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E):=S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. At a high level, this framework reframes intelligence and interpretability as geometric problems on similarity fields -- preserving and composing level-set fibers -- rather than purely statistical ones. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in a framework that not only interprets large language models but also introduces a novel way of using them as experimental probes of societal cognition, supported by preliminary evidence across diverse consumer categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Online Sampling from Possibly Moving Target Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11571v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We suppose we are given a list of points $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}$, a target probability measure $\mu$ and are asked to add additional points $x_{n+1}, \dots, x_{n+m}$ so that $x_1, \dots, x_{n+m}$ is as close as possible to the distribution of $\mu$; additionally, we want this to be true uniformly for all $m$. We propose a simple method that achieves this goal. It selects new points in regions where the existing set is lacking points and avoids regions that are already overly crowded. If we replace $\mu$ by another measure $\mu_2$ in the middle of the computation, the method dynamically adjusts and allows us to keep the original sampling points. $x_{n+1}$ can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ steps and we obtain state-of-the-art results. It appears to be an interesting dynamical system in its own right; we analyze a continuous mean-field version that reflects much of the same behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs for Interpretable Learning and Symbolic Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18339v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence of hybrid computational dynamics through reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11162v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL, which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for designing adaptive AI systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Optimal Multi-Modal Transportation and Electric Power Flow: The Value of Coordinated Dynamic Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10914v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrification of transportation represents a critical challenge in the global transition toward net-zero emissions, as the sector often accounts for more than one-quarter of national energy consumption. Achieving this transformation requires not only widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) but also their seamless integration into interdependent infrastructure systems-specifically, the transportation-electricity nexus (TEN). This paper develops an optimal multi-modal transportation and electric power flow (OMTEPF) model to evaluate the benefits of coordinated, dynamic system operation. Building on recent advances in hetero-functional graph theory, the framework enables joint optimization of five key operational decisions in intelligent TEN management: vehicle dispatch, route choice, charging station queuing, coordinated charging, and vehicle-to-grid stabilization. The mesoscopic, dynamic model explicitly represents individual EVs and their state-of-charge trajectories, thereby extending beyond the prevailing literature's focus on static, macroscopic traffic assignment. It further captures the full scope of the TEN as a system-of-systems, incorporating five distinct charging modalities: private residential, private commercial, wired public commercial, inductive public, and discharging. On the power system side, an IV-ACOPF formulation ensures globally optimal solutions to the electrical subproblems. Comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial value of coordinated TEN operation relative to the status quo of siloed, uncoordinated infrastructure management. This work provides both a novel methodological contribution and actionable insights for the co-design and operation of next-generation sustainable mobility-energy systems.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

| **[DUST: A Framework for Data-Driven Density Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02777v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of data-driven stochastic optimal control of an unknown LTI dynamical system. Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace identification to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with stochastic uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The first and second moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainty. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Automatica</p></details> |

In our framework, token embeddings evolve under a partial differential equation whose nonlocal integral term models self-attention, local reaction term models feed-forward layers, diffusion term encodes positional smoothing, and a stability control term corresponds to layer normalization. From this unifying perspective, we design an Adaptive PDE Diffusion Layer-an efficient, learnable finite-difference stencil that enforces local smoothness in feature space with linear time complexity and complements self-attention's global routing. Through a systematic theoretical analysis based on four pillars:stability, diffusion geometry, multi-scale dynamics, and component coupling, we derive principled guidelines for integrating the PDE layer at seven candidate points in the Transformer. Empirically, on the Long Range Arena benchmark, placing the layer immediately after embedding yields a 4.1 pp average accuracy gain over a strong baseline, and an adaptive multi-scale variant delivers further improvements. Our work thus offers a principled, lightweight mechanism to bolster long-range dependency modeling by harmonizing continuous PDE smoothing with discrete self-attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as \emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local) actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} -- equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii) \emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations} (prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurReps 2025 (https://www.neurreps.org)</p></details> |

We also present a feedback linearization based control design scheme that renders a partially unknown system incrementally input-to-state practically stable and safe with formal guarantees. To deal with the unknown dynamics, we utilize Gaussian process regression to approximate the model. Finally, we implement the controller synthesized by the proposed scheme on a manipulator example</p></details> | 2 figures,9 pages |

In contrast to conventional hypothesis-driven biophysical models, the AI-based surrogate brain encompasses a broad spectrum of data-driven approaches to solve the inverse problem, with the primary objective of accurately predicting future whole-brain dynamics with historical data. Here, we introduce a unified framework of constructing an AI-based surrogate brain that integrates forward modeling, inverse problem solving, and model evaluation. Leveraging the expressive power of AI models and large-scale brain data, surrogate brains open a new window for decoding neural systems and forecasting complex dynamics with high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and adaptability. We highlight that the learned surrogate brain serves as a simulation platform for dynamical systems analysis, virtual perturbation, and model-guided neurostimulation. We envision that the AI-based surrogate brain will provide a functional bridge between theoretical neuroscience and translational neuroengineering.</p></details> | 5 figures |
| **[Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference taking place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in May 2026</p></details> |
| **[Distributionally Robust Control with End-to-End Statistically Guaranteed Metric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10214v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems. However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate. Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness compared against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
