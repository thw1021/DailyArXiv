| **[VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALM-PDE: Continuous and Adaptive Convolutions for Latent Space Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12944v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025, San Diego, California, USA</p></details> |
| **[The inverse initial data problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations via Legendre time reduction method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16810v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the inverse initial data problem for the compressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial velocity field from lateral boundary observations. This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding diffusion models to reconstruct flow fields from sparse data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19971v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/tum-pbs/sparse-reconstruction</p></details> |
| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16992v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code at https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT</p></details> |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unconditionally Stable, Variable Step DLN Methods for the Allen-Cahn Active Fluid Model: A Divergence-free Preserving Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16860v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the divergence-free mixed finite element method (FEM) for nonlinear fourth-order Allen-Cahn phase field coupled active fluid equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$, the original fourth-order problem is converted into a system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-comforming finite element spaces. To further refine the formulation, an additional auxiliary variable $\xi$, analogous to the pressure, is introduced, resulting in a mixed finite element scheme that preserves the divergence-free condition in $which = \Delta u$ inherited from the model. A fully discrete scheme is then established by combining the spatial approximation by the divergence-free mixed finite element method with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme is rigorously derived under suitable regularity assumptions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on the minimum dissipation criterion is carried out to enhance computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrivAerStar: An Industrial-Grade CFD Dataset for Vehicle Aerodynamic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16857v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16399v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AB-UPT for Automotive and Aerospace Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15808v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) shows strong capabilities to replicate automotive computational fluid dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both datasets were generated with the Luminary Cloud platform containing automotives (SHIFT-SUV) and aircrafts (SHIFT-Wing). We start by detailing the data generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model. AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near perfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a simple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a day on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNO: Multiscale Neural Operator for Computational Fluid Dynamics with 3D Point Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16071v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Clifford-Steerable CNNs with Complete Kernel Basis for PDE Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our method consistently outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Property Testing for Ocean Models. Can We Specify It? (Invited Talk)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13692v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I take inspiration from the property-testing literature, particularly the work of Prof. John Hughes, and explore how such ideas might be applied to numerical models of the ocean. Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address the oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a number of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These examples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying property tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and useful, remains to be seen.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings VSS 2025, arXiv:2510.12314</p></details> |
| **[Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Prior for First Order Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20278v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design optimization aims to infer system parameters from observed solutions, posing critical challenges across domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, structural engineering, materials science, and fluid dynamics. The lack of explicit mathematical representations in many systems complicates this process and makes the first order optimization impossible. Mainstream approaches, including generative AI and Bayesian optimization, address these challenges but have limitations. Generative AI is computationally expensive, while Bayesian optimization, relying on surrogate models, suffers from scalability, sensitivity to priors, and noise issues, often leading to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces Deep Physics Prior (DPP), a novel method enabling first-order gradient-based inverse optimization with surrogate machine learning models. By leveraging pretrained auxiliary Neural Operators, DPP enforces prior distribution constraints to ensure robust and meaningful solutions. This approach is particularly effective when prior data and observation distributions are unknown.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |

| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |
| **[Asynchronous Agents with Perfect Recall: Model Reductions, Knowledge-Based Construction, and Model Checking for Coalitional Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06706v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model checking of strategic abilities for agents with memory is a notoriously hard problem, and very few attempts have been made to tackle it. In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimality-Based Control Space Reduction for Infinite-Dimensional Control Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14479v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider linear model reduction in both the control and state variables for unconstrained linear-quadratic optimal control problems subject to time-varying parabolic PDEs. The first-order optimality condition for a state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space reduction.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |
| **[Likelihood-informed Model Reduction for Bayesian Inference of Static Structural Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07950v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use data to update a prior probability distribution on uncertain parameter values to a posterior distribution. Such problems arise in many structural engineering applications, but computational solution of Bayesian inverse problems is often expensive because standard solution approaches require many evaluations of the forward model mapping the parameter value to predicted observations. In many settings, this forward model is expensive because it requires the solution of a high-dimensional discretization of a partial differential equation. However, Bayesian inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure because the available data are primarily informative (relative to the prior) in a low-dimensional subspace, sometimes called the likelihood-informed subspace (LIS). This paper proposes a new projection-based model reduction method for static linear systems that exploits this low-dimensional structure in the setting where the unknown parameter is the right-hand-side forcing. The proposed method projects the governing partial differential equation onto the likelihood-informed subspace, yielding a computationally efficient reduced model that can be used to accelerate the solution of the inverse problem. Numerical experiments on two structural engineering model problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully exploit the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the problem, obtaining relative errors of O(10^{-10}) in the inverse problem solution with a 10x-100x lower-dimensional model.</p></details> |  |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

We introduce an efficient algorithm for solving such parameter-dependent linear systems for many values of $p$. The algorithm, which we call SubApSnap (for \emph{Sub}sampled $A(p)$ times \emph{Snap}shot), is based on combining ideas from model order reduction and randomised linear algebra: namely, taking a snapshot matrix, and solving the resulting tall-skinny least-squares problems using a subsampling-based dimension-reduction approach. We show that SubApSnap is a strict generalisation of the popular DEIM algorithm in nonlinear model order reduction. SubApSnap is a sublinear-time algorithm, and once the snapshot and subsampling are determined, it solves $A(p_*)x(p_*)=b(p_*)$ for a new value of $p_*$ at a dramatically improved speed: it does not even need to read the whole matrix $A(p_*)$ to solve the linear system for a new value of $p_*$. We prove under natural assumptions that, given a good subsampling and snapshot, SubApSnap yields solutions with small residual for all parameter values of interest. We illustrate the efficiency and performance of the algorithm with problems arising in PDEs, model reduction, and kernel ridge regression, where SubApSnap achieves speedups of many orders of magnitude over a standard solution; for example over $20,000\times$ for a $10^7\times 10^7$ problem, while providing good accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p></details> |  |

This demand response strategy helps distribution grid to flexibly ramp-up or ramp-down local load demand so that it can optimally match the bulk power system generation profile. However, achieving this capability requires house thermal models that are both computationally efficient and robust to operating conditions. In this work, parameters of the Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network thermal model for houses are estimated using three optimization algorithms: Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), Batch Estimation (BE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The resulting models are evaluated through a Forward-Simulation across four different seasons and three setpoints. The results illustrate a principled way of selecting reduced order models and estimation methods with respect to the robustness offered to seasonal and setpoint variations in training-testing datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a version of our paper accepted at the 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS) 2025</p></details> |

We utilize this framework to parameterize the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile phase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation analytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate synthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary conditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of advection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of required forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a reduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the advection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the synthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by Projected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against several alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global random optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using nearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to 295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers accurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers to link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics, and measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the analysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional forward simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Water Resources Research</p></details> |

To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regul...</summary><p>Regular research article, 28 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields. We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving performance estimation of a PCM-integrated solar chimney through reduced-order based data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16469v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM) integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and 203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |

In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |

Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Partial Differential Equations on Parameter-Dependent Domains Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17171v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or the solution of the equations over multiple parameters. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, reduced order models (ROMs) are built using a set of precomputed solutions (snapshots) corresponding to different parameter values. Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM, offering improved flexibility and performance. In many cases, the domain on which the PDE is defined also varies. Capturing this variation is important for building accurate ROMs but is often difficult, especially when the domain has a complex structure or changes topology. In this paper, we propose a Deep-ROM framework that can automatically extract useful domain parametrization and incorporate it into the model. Unlike traditional domain parameterization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. It can also learn from domain data even when no mesh is available. Using deep autoencoders, our approach reduces the dimensionality of both the PDE solution and the domain representation, making it possible to approximate solutions efficiently across a wide range of domain shapes and parameter values. We demonstrate that our approach produces parametrizations that yield solution accuracy comparable to models using exact parameters. Importantly, our model remains stable under moderate geometric variations in the domain, such as boundary deformations and noise - scenarios where traditional ROMs often require remeshing or manual adjustment.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Statistical reduced order modelling for the parametric Helmholtz equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04438v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, associated code available at https://github.com/herluc/statROM.

DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |

| **[Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25.

| **[Return of ChebNet: Understanding and Improving an Overlooked GNN on Long Range Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07624v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Lyapunov-Based Physics-Informed Deep Neural Networks with Skew Symmetry Considerations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21051v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box function approximators which have been shown to yield improved performance compared to traditional neural network (NN) architectures. However, black-box algorithms do not incorporate known physics of the system and can yield results which are physically implausible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity due to their ability to leverage known physical principles in the learning process which has been empirically shown to improve performance compared to traditional black-box methods. This paper introduces the first physics-informed DNN controller for an Euler-Lagrange dynamic system where the adaptation laws are designed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis to account for the skew-symmetry property of the inertia matrix and centripetal-Coriolis matrix. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and the skew-symmetric prediction error. Simulations indicate that the developed update law demonstrates improvement in individual and overall function approximation capabilities when compared to a physics-informed adaptation law which does not incorporate knowledge of system symmetries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19458v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Time-Evolving Dynamical System for Learning Latent Representations of Mouse Visual Neural Activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07908v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seeking high-quality representations with latent variable models (LVMs) to reveal the intrinsic correlation between neural activity and behavior or sensory stimuli has attracted much interest. In the study of the biological visual system, naturalistic visual stimuli are inherently high-dimensional and time-dependent, leading to intricate dynamics within visual neural activity. However, most work on LVMs has not explicitly considered neural temporal relationships. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Evolving Visual Dynamical System (TE-ViDS), a sequential LVM that decomposes neural activity into low-dimensional latent representations that evolve over time. To better align the model with the characteristics of visual neural activity, we split latent representations into two parts and apply contrastive learning to shape them. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real neural datasets from the mouse visual cortex demonstrate that TE-ViDS achieves the best decoding performance on naturalistic scenes/movies, extracts interpretable latent trajectories that uncover clear underlying neural dynamics, and provides new insights into differences in visual information processing between subjects and between cortical regions. In summary, TE-ViDS is markedly competent in extracting stimulus-relevant embeddings from visual neural activity and contributes to the understanding of visual processing mechanisms. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Grasshlw/Time-Evolving-Visual-Dynamical-System.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[One-Step Offline Distillation of Diffusion-based Models via Koopman Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13358v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model (KDM), a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory - a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. KDM achieves highly competitive performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence in On-line Learning of Static and Dynamic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03049v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper derives analytical expressions for the asymptotic average updating direction of the adaptive moment generation (ADAM) algorithm when applied to recursive identification of nonlinear systems. It is proved that the standard hyper-parameter setting results in the same asymptotic average updating direction as a diagonally power normalized stochastic gradient algorithm. With the internal filtering turned off, the asymptotic average updating direction is instead equivalent to that of a sign-sign stochastic gradient algorithm. Global convergence to an invariant set follows, where a subset of parameters contain those that give a correct input-output description of the system. The paper also exploits a nonlinear dynamic model to embed structure in recurrent neural networks. A Monte-Carlo simulation study validates the results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multicast-partitioning in Time-triggered Stream Planning for Time-Sensitive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20440v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multicast allows sending a message to multiple recipients without having to create and send a separate message for each recipient. This preserves network bandwidth, which is particularly important in time-sensitive networks. These networks are commonly used to provide latency-bounded communication for real-time systems in domains like automotive, avionics, industrial internet of things, automated shop floors, and smart energy grids. The preserved bandwidth can be used to admit additional real-time messages with specific quality of service requirements or to reduce the end-to-end latencies for messages of any type. However, using multicast communication can complicate traffic planning, as it requires free queues or available downstream egress ports on all branches of the multicast tree. In this work, we present a novel multicast partitioning technique to split multicast trees into smaller multicast or unicast trees. This allows for a more fine-grained trade-off between bandwidth utilization and traffic scheduling difficulty. Thus, schedulability in dynamic systems can be improved, in terms the number of admitted streams and the accumulated network throughput. We evaluated the multicast partitioning on different network topologies and with three different scheduling algorithms. With the partitioning, 5-15\% fewer streams were rejected, while achieving 5-125\% more network throughput, depending on the scheduling algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Hybrid Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22894v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid dynamical systems pose significant challenges for effective planning and control, especially when additional constraints such as obstacle avoidance, state boundaries, and actuation limits are present. In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |
| **[IEnSF: Iterative Ensemble Score Filter for Reducing Error in Posterior Score Estimation in Nonlinear Data Assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20159v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) has emerged as a promising approach to leverage score-based diffusion models for solving high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. While initial applications of EnSF to the Lorenz-96 model and the quasi-geostrophic system showed potential, the current method employs a heuristic weighted sum to combine the prior and the likelihood score functions. This introduces a structural error into the estimation of the posterior score function in the nonlinear setting. This work addresses this challenge by developing an iterative ensemble score filter (IEnSF) that applies an iterative algorithm as an outer loop around the reverse-time stochastic differential equation solver. When the state dynamics or the observation operator is nonlinear, the iterative algorithm can gradually reduce the posterior score estimation error by improving the accuracy of approximating the conditional expectation of the likelihood score function. The number of iterations required depends on the distance between the prior and posterior distributions and the nonlinearity of the observation operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the IEnSF algorithm substantially reduces the error in posterior score estimation in the nonlinear setting and thus improves the accuracy of tracking high-dimensional dynamical systems.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Environment Inference for Learning Generalizable Dynamical System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19784v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation, enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-intrusive structural-preserving sequential data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19701v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation (DA) methods combine model predictions with observational data to improve state estimation in dynamical systems, inspiring their increasingly prominent role in geophysical and climate applications. Classical DA methods assume that the governing equations modeling the dynamics are known, which is unlikely for most real world applications. Machine learning (ML) provides a flexible alternative by learning surrogate models directly from data, but standard ML methods struggle in noisy and data-scarce environments, where meaningful extrapolation requires incorporating physical constraints. Recent advances in structure-preserving ML architectures, such as the development of the entropy-stable conservative flux form network (ESCFN), highlight the critical role of physical structure in improving learning stability and accuracy for unknown systems of conservation laws. Structural information has also been shown to improve DA performance. Gradient-based measures of spatial variability, in particular, can help refine ensemble updates in discontinuous systems. Motivated by both of these recent innovations, this investigation proposes a new non-intrusive, structure-preserving sequential data assimilation (NSSDA) framework that leverages structure at both the forecast and analysis stages. We use the ESCFN to construct a surrogate model to preserve physical laws during forecasting, and a structurally informed ensemble transform Kalman filter (SETKF) to embed local statistical structure into the assimilation step. Our method operates in a highly constrained environment, using only a single noisy trajectory for both training and assimilation. Numerical experiments where the unknown dynamics correspond respectively to the shallow water and Euler equations demonstrate significantly improved predictive accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational demands often become a significant barrier as the number of agents and complexity of the simulation increase. Traditional ABM platforms often struggle to fully exploit modern computing resources, hindering the development of large-scale simulations. This paper presents Vahana.jl, a high performance computing open source framework that aims to address these limitations. Building on the formalism of synchronous graph dynamical systems, Vahana.jl is especially well suited for models with a focus on (social) networks. The framework seamlessly supports distribution across multiple compute nodes, enabling simulations that would otherwise be beyond the capabilities of a single machine. Implemented in Julia, Vahana.jl leverages the interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment, facilitating rapid model development and experimentation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Extreme Event Aware ($η$-) Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19161v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or $\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted' extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method. Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and real-world precipitation downscaling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions at PNAS</p></details> |

Given a single trajectory of input-output samples, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the system's Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization of the bilinear system can be obtained. Our bilinear system identification algorithm learns the system's Markov-like parameters by regressing the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. Moreover, the stability of BLDS depends on the sequence of inputs used to excite the system. These properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these insights.</p></details> |  |

Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.</p></details> |  |

The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across the natural and social sciences. Yet current solutions either rely heavily on prior knowledge of the dynamics or involve intricate training procedures. We introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a pretrained recognition model that delivers accurate in-context (or zero-shot) estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of low-dimensional SDEs, from noisy time series data, and allows rapid finetuning to target datasets. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we (pre)train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion to map a large set of noisy, discretely observed SDE paths onto the space of drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that FIM-SDE achieves robust in-context function estimation across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes -- from canonical SDE systems (e.g., double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Lorenz attractors) to stock price recordings and oil-price and wind-speed fluctuations -- while matching the performance of symbolic, Gaussian process and Neural SDE baselines trained on the target datasets. When finetuned to the target processes, we show that FIM-SDE consistently outperforms all these baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want. Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints, moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regul...</summary><p>Regular research article, 28 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic systems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |

Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera ready version.

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go, and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying initial conditions.</p></details> |  |

Key principles: (1) event as an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models (conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before - the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3) making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms (A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3) without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from different subjects).</p></details> | 32 pages |

This task becomes a significant challenge when the underlying dynamics are changing with time. Motivated by this challenge, this paper considers the problem of controlling an unknown Markov jump linear system (MJS) to optimize a quadratic objective. By taking a model-based perspective, we consider identification-based adaptive control of MJSs. We first provide a system identification algorithm for MJS to learn the dynamics in each mode as well as the Markov transition matrix, underlying the evolution of the mode switches, from a single trajectory of the system states, inputs, and modes. Through martingale-based arguments, sample complexity of this algorithm is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then propose an adaptive control scheme that performs system identification together with certainty equivalent control to adapt the controllers in an episodic fashion. Combining our sample complexity results with recent perturbation results for certainty equivalent control, we prove that when the episode lengths are appropriately chosen, the proposed adaptive control scheme achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, which can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(polylog(T))$ with partial knowledge of the system. Our proof strategy introduces innovations to handle Markovian jumps and a weaker notion of stability common in MJSs. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and control performance. Numerical simulations are presented to further reinforce these insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improved results using Martingale-based arguments</p></details> |
| **[Navigating the Latent Space Dynamics of Neural Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22785v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold, derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Convergence Rates for Gradient Descent on the Edge of Stability in Overparametrised Least Squares](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17506v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime. In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima. In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c) the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat global minimum.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2025.

However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |

However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.

In this chapter we show how state-dependent delays arise naturally when modeling and the consequences that follow. We treat discrete state-dependent delays, and delays implicitly defined by threshold conditions. We will consider modeling, formulation as dynamical systems, linearization, and numerical techniques. For discrete state-dependent delays we show how breaking points can be tracked efficiently to preserve the order of numerical methods for simulating solutions. For threshold conditions we will discuss how a velocity ratio term arises in models, and present a heuristic linearization method that avoids Banach spaces and sun-star calculus, making the method accessible to a wider audience. We will also discuss numerical implementations of threshold and distributed delay problems which allows them to be treated numerically with standard software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on presentations at "Delays and Structures in Dynamical Systems: Modeling, Analysis and Numerical Methods" at the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences (CISM) in November 2023 in Udine</p></details> |

By integrating the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis with hierarchical density-based clustering, our framework captures the intrinsic structure of event data to recover both amplitude and frequency with high fidelity. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over prior methods and enable simultaneous recovery of multiple sound sources from a single event stream, advancing the frontier of passive, illumination-free vibration sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Learning these dynamics from data is particularly challenging in high-dimensional settings with complex, correlated, or state-dependent noise. We introduce a noise-aware system identification framework that jointly recovers the deterministic drift and full noise structure directly from the trajectory data, without requiring prior assumptions on the noise model. Our method accommodates a broad class of stochastic dynamics, including colored and multiplicative noise, that scales efficiently to high-dimensional systems, and accurately reconstructs the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments on diverse systems validate the approach and highlight its potential for data-driven modeling in complex stochastic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.02595</p></details> |
| **[Neuronal Group Communication for Efficient Neural representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16851v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 2 figures |

For routing within this framework, we implement a parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm, utilizing GPU acceleration to evaluate path segments efficiently. To address scalability challenges inherent in large routing graphs, we introduce a segmentation strategy that preserves performance while maintaining tractable memory requirements.

We consider systems with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. An adversary is assumed to execute an inference attack by exploiting the observed public state set to estimate an uncertainty set for the private state. The volume of this inferred set quantifies the adversary's estimation uncertainty and serves as the proposed volumetric privacy metric. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that it is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the volumetric privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we show that a selection principle from the theory of differential inclusions transforms the dual lasso problem into the problem of calculating the trajectory of a projected dynamical system that we prove is integrable. Our analysis yields an exact algorithm for the lasso problem, numerically up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and is very fast. Moreover, we show the continuation of solutions to the integrable projected dynamical system in terms of the hyperparameter naturally yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in both efficiency and accuracy. Beyond this work, we expect our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 2 figures, submitted</p></details> |
| **[Simulation-free Structure Learning for Stochastic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16656v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics -- a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.</p></details> |  |

At each discrete-time step, the players can take over or retain control, incurring state and control-dependent costs. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, with a discrete \texttt{FlipDyn} state determining control authority. Our contributions are: (i) For arbitrary non-negative costs, we derive the saddle-point value of the \texttt{FlipDyn} game and the corresponding Nash equilibria (NE) takeover strategies. (ii) For linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we establish sufficient conditions under which the game admits an NE. (iii) For scalar linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive parameterized NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state. (iv) For higher-dimensional linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive approximate NE takeover strategies and control policies, and compute bounds on the saddle-point values. We validate our results through a numerical study on adversarial control of a linear system.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 2 figures.

However, learning PDEs with varying parameters and changing initial conditions and boundary conditions (ICBCs) with theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose physics-informed deep B-spline networks, a novel technique that approximates a family of PDEs with different parameters and ICBCs by learning B-spline control points through neural networks. The proposed B-spline representation reduces the learning task from predicting solution values over the entire domain to learning a compact set of control points, enforces strict compliance to initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions by construction, and enables analytical computation of derivatives for incorporating PDE residual losses. While existing approximation and generalization theories are not applicable in this setting - where solutions of parametrized PDE families are represented via B-spline bases - we fill this gap by showing that B-spline networks are universal approximators for such families under mild conditions. We also derive generalization error bounds for physics-informed learning in both elliptic and parabolic PDE settings, establishing new theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate in experiments that the proposed technique has improved efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs compared to existing techniques in a dynamical system problem with discontinuous ICBCs and can handle nonhomogeneous ICBCs and non-rectangular domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Targeting in Dynamic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00312v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern treatment targeting methods often rely on estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using machine learning tools. While effective in identifying who benefits from treatment on the individual level, these approaches typically overlook system-level dynamics that may arise when treatments induce strain on shared capacity. We study the problem of targeting in Markovian systems, where treatment decisions must be made one at a time as units arrive, and early decisions can impact later outcomes through delayed or limited access to resources. We show that optimal policies in such settings compare CATE-like quantities to state-specific thresholds, where each threshold reflects the expected cumulative impact on the system of treating an additional individual in the given state. We propose an algorithm that augments standard CATE estimation with off-policy evaluation techniques to estimate these thresholds from observational data. Theoretical results establish consistency and convergence guarantees, and empirical studies demonstrate that our method improves long-run outcomes considerably relative to individual-level CATE targeting rules.</p></details> |  |

In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |

Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |
