| **[ECO: Energy-Constrained Operator Learning for Chaotic Dynamics with Boundedness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01984v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize. We demonstrate empirical success in ECO's ability to generate stable long-horizon forecasts, capturing invariant statistics on systems governed by chaotic PDEs, including the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and the Navier--Stokes equations.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate scalable and efficient simulations in the public cloud. We perform meso-scale simulations of blood flow in image-reconstructed capillaries, and examine targeted drug delivery by artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs). The simulations deploy dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) with two software frameworks, Mirheo (developed by our team) and LAMMPS. Mirheo exhibits remarkable weak scalability for up to 512 GPUs. Similarly, LAMMPS demonstrated excellent weak scalability for pure solvent as well as for blood suspensions and ABFs in reconstructed retinal capillaries. In particular, LAMMPS maintained weak scaling above 90% on the cloud for up to 2,000 cores. Our findings demonstrate that cloud computing can support tightly coupled, large-scale scientific simulations with competitive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSPT: Efficient Large-Scale Physical Modeling via Parallelized Multi-Scale Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01738v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation: A Perspective from Computational Fluid Dynamics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01319v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx. Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit. Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORGI: GNNs with Convolutional Residual Global Interactions for Lagrangian Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22938v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to dynamical systems modeling, particularly in hydrodynamics, where traditional solvers often struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost. Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22819v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Data efficient surrogate modeling for engineering design: Ensemble-free batch mode deep active learning for regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10360v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High fidelity design evaluation processes such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis are often replaced with data driven surrogates to reduce computational cost in engineering design optimization. However, building accurate surrogate models still requires a large number of expensive simulations. To address this challenge, we introduce epsilon HQS, a scalable active learning strategy that leverages a student teacher framework to train deep neural networks efficiently. Unlike Bayesian AL methods, which are computationally demanding with DNNs, epsilon HQS selectively queries informative samples to reduce labeling cost. Applied to CFD, FEA, and propeller design tasks, our method achieves higher accuracy under fixed labeling cost budgets.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Particle Dynamics Subject to Rigid Body Manipulations Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03446v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics, and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. Our approach accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on single-object manipulation tasks, our model generalizes effectively to environments with novel objects and novel manipulation tasks. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompARE: A Computational framework for Airborne Respiratory disease Evaluation integrating flow physics and human behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21782v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk of indoor airborne transmission among co-located individuals is generally non-uniform, which remains a critical challenge for public health modelling. Thus, we present CompARE, an integrated risk assessment framework for indoor airborne disease transmission that reveals a striking bimodal distribution of infection risk driven by airflow dynamics and human behavior. Combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), machine learning (ML), and agent-based modeling (ABM), our model captures the complex interplay between aerosol transport, human mobility, and environmental context. Based on a prototypical childcare center, our approach quantifies how incorporation of ABM can unveil significantly different infection risk profiles across agents, with more than two-fold change in risk of infection between the individuals with the lowest and highest risks in more than 90% of cases, despite all individuals being in the same overall environment. We found that infection risk distributions can exhibit not only a striking bimodal pattern in certain activities but also exponential decay and fat-tailed behavior in others. Specifically, we identify low-risk modes arising from source containment, as well as high-risk tails from prolonged close contact. Our approach enables near-real-time scenario analysis and provides policy-relevant quantitative insights into how ventilation design, spatial layout, and social distancing policies can mitigate transmission risk. These findings challenge simple distance-based heuristics and support the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions in high-occupancy indoor settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) offers an interpretable alternative to conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, which are often criticized as ``black boxes''. In contrast to standard regression models that require a prescribed functional form, SR constructs expressions from a user-defined set of mathematical primitives, enabling the automated discovery of compact formulas that fit the data and reveal underlying physical relationships. In fluid mechanics, where understanding the underlying physics is as crucial as predictive accuracy, this study applies SR to model three-dimensional (3D) laminar flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the axial velocity and pressure fields. Compact symbolic equations were derived from numerical simulation data, accurately reproducing the expected parabolic velocity profile and linear pressure drop, and showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions from the literature. To address the limitation that purely data-driven SR models may overlook domain-specific constraints, an innovative hybrid framework that integrates SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is also introduced. This integration combines the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning capabilities of ASP, ensuring that derived equations remain both statistically accurate and physically plausible. The proposed SR/ASP methodology demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-representation approaches to enhance interpretability, reliability, and alignment with physical principles in fluid dynamics and related domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |
| **[Indoor Fluid Antenna Systems Enabled by Layout-Specific Modeling and Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15006v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna system (FAS) revolutionizes wireless communications via utilizing position-flexible antennas that dynamically optimize channel conditions and mitigate multipath fading. This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures;</p></details> |
| **[FunDiff: Diffusion Models over Function Spaces for Physics-Informed Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07902v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/sifanexisted/fundiff.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19390v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04898v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh-Quantization for Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18474v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDBench: Benchmarking Data-Driven Methods for Model Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20529v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems: An Extreme Value Theory Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17916v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna systems (FAS) allow dynamic reconfiguration to achieve superior diversity gains and reliability. To quantify the performance scaling of FAS with a large number of antenna ports, this paper leverages extreme value theory (EVT) to conduct an asymptotic analysis of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC). The analysis reveals that the OP decays approximately exponentially with the number of antenna ports. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic EC, uncovering its double-logarithmic scaling law. Furthermore, we re-substantiate these scaling laws by exploiting the fact that the mode of the Gumbel distribution scales logarithmically. Besides, we theoretically prove that spatial correlation among antenna ports degrades both OP and EC. All analytical findings are conclusively validated by numerical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Birkhoff Averages Accelerate Data-Driven Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17772v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Niño data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</p></details> |  |

| **[Lockpicking LLMs: A Logit-Based Jailbreak Using Token-level Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13068v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing, but they remain susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that exploit their capabilities to generate unintended and potentially harmful content. Existing token-level jailbreaking techniques, while effective, face scalability and efficiency challenges, especially as models undergo frequent updates and incorporate advanced defensive measures. In this paper, we introduce JailMine, an innovative token-level manipulation approach that addresses these limitations effectively. JailMine employs an automated "mining" process to elicit malicious responses from LLMs by strategically selecting affirmative outputs and iteratively reducing the likelihood of rejection. Through rigorous testing across multiple well-known LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate JailMine's effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a significant average reduction of 86% in time consumed while maintaining high success rates averaging 95%, even in the face of evolving defensive strategies. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to assess and mitigate the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks, underscoring the importance of continued vigilance and proactive measures to enhance the security and reliability of these powerful language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DYNEMO-SLAM: Dynamic Entity and Motion-Aware 3D Scene Graph SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02050v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in dynamic environments face significant challenges due to the presence of moving agents and displaced objects. Traditional SLAM systems typically assume a static world or treat dynamic as outliers, discarding their information to preserve map consistency. As a result, they cannot exploit dynamic entities as persistent landmarks, do not model and exploit their motion over time, and therefore quickly degrade in highly cluttered environments with few reliable static features. This paper presents a novel 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic entities into the SLAM backend. Our framework incorporates semantic motion priors and dynamic entity-aware constraints to jointly optimize the robot trajectory, dynamic entity poses, and the surrounding environment structure within a unified graph formulation. In parallel, a dynamic keyframe selection policy and a semantic loop-closure prefiltering step enable the system to remain robust and effective in highly dynamic environments by continuously adapting to scene changes and filtering inconsistent observations. The simulation and real-world experimental results show a 49.97% reduction in ATE compared to the baseline method employed, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating dynamic entities and estimating their poses for improved robustness and richer scene representation in complex scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Uncertainty for Detecting and Correcting Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13813v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate impressive results across diverse tasks but are still known to hallucinate, generating linguistically plausible but incorrect answers to questions. Uncertainty quantification has been proposed as a strategy for hallucination detection, requiring estimates for both global uncertainty (attributed to a batch of responses) and local uncertainty (attributed to individual responses). While recent black-box approaches have shown some success, they often rely on disjoint heuristics or graph-theoretic approximations that lack a unified geometric interpretation. We introduce a geometric framework to address this, based on archetypal analysis of batches of responses sampled with only black-box model access. At the global level, we propose Geometric Volume, which measures the convex hull volume of archetypes derived from response embeddings. At the local level, we propose Geometric Suspicion, which leverages the spatial relationship between responses and these archetypes to rank reliability, enabling hallucination reduction through preferential response selection. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete pairwise comparisons, our approach provides continuous semantic boundary points which have utility for attributing reliability to individual responses. Experiments show that our framework performs comparably to or better than prior methods on short form question-answering datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets where hallucinations carry particularly critical risks. We also provide theoretical justification by proving a link between convex hull volume and entropy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision.

Linear constraints are useful in a wide range of applications, allowing the fitting of model with high-dimensional or highly collinear predictors, as well as encoding assumptions on the association between some or all predictors and the response. We propose the constrained iteratively-reweighted least squares (CIRLS) to fit the model, iterating quadratic programs to ensure the coefficient vector remains feasible according to the constraints. Inference for constrained coefficients can be obtained by simulating from a truncated multivariate normal distribution and computing empirical confidence intervals or variance-covariance matrix from the simulated coefficient vectors. We additionally discuss the complexity of a constrained GLM, proposing a measure of expected degrees of freedom which accounts for the stringency of constraints in the reduction of the model degrees of freedom. An extensive simulations study shows that constraining the coefficients introduces some bias to the estimation, but also decreases the estimator variance. This trade-off results in an improved estimator when constraints are chosen appropriately. The simulations also show that our proposed inference results in error in variance estimation and coverage. The proposed framework is illustrated on two case studies, showing its usefulness as well as some of its weaknesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer reviewed publication.

| **[Exploring Definitions of Quality and Diversity in Sonic Measurement Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02783v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital sound synthesis presents the opportunity to explore vast parameter spaces containing millions of configurations. Quality diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to harness this potential, yet their success hinges on appropriate sonic feature representations. Existing QD methods predominantly employ handcrafted descriptors or supervised classifiers, potentially introducing unintended exploration biases and constraining discovery to familiar sonic regions. This work investigates unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for automatically defining and dynamically reconfiguring sonic behaviour spaces during QD search. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders to project high-dimensional audio features onto structured grids for MAP-Elites, implementing dynamic reconfiguration through model retraining at regular intervals. Comparison across two experimental scenarios shows that automatic approaches achieve significantly greater diversity than handcrafted behaviour spaces while avoiding expert-imposed biases. Dynamic behaviour-space reconfiguration maintains evolutionary pressure and prevents stagnation, with PCA proving most effective among the dimensionality reduction techniques. These results contribute to automated sonic discovery systems capable of exploring vast parameter spaces without manual intervention or supervised training constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00561v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ can achieve remarkably high encoding rates (about 30% and 20% at concatenation levels 3 and 4, respectively), they have large code block sizes at high levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates per block high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we comprehensively investigate smaller many-hypercube codes with $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a notable fact that $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in PACLIC 2025</p></details> |

We show that this critical issue stems largely from low-quality data that contains inherently ambiguous preference pairs. To address this challenge, we propose ELSPR, a principled graph-theoretic framework that models pairwise preferences as tournament graphs and systematically identifies problematic training data. ELSPR quantifies non-transitivity through strongly connected components (SCCs) analysis and measures overall preference clarity using a novel normalized directed graph structural entropy metric. Our filtering methodology selectively removes preference data that induce non-transitivity while preserving transitive preferences. Extensive experiments on the AlpacaEval benchmark demonstrate that models fine-tuned on ELSPR-filtered data achieve substantial improvements: a 13.8% reduction in non-transitivity, a 0.088 decrease in structural entropy, and significantly enhanced discriminative power in real-world evaluation systems. Human validation confirms that discarded data exhibit dramatically lower inter-annotator agreement (34.4% vs. 52.6%) and model-human consistency (51.2% vs. 80.6%) compared to cleaned data. These findings establish ELSPR as an effective data self-purification approach for developing more robust, consistent, and human-aligned LLM evaluation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Evaluating Fake-News Detection and Virality Prediction under Real-World Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02552v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Distillation with Self-Consistency Cascades: A Simple, Training-Free Way to Reduce LLM Agent Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02543v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Confidential, Attestable, and Efficient Inter-CVM Communication with Arm CCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01594v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) are increasingly adopted to protect sensitive workloads from privileged adversaries such as the hypervisor. While they provide strong isolation guarantees, existing CVM architectures lack first-class mechanisms for inter-CVM data sharing due to their disjoint memory model, making inter-CVM data exchange a performance bottleneck in compartmentalized or collaborative multi-CVM systems. Under this model, a CVM's accessible memory is either shared with the hypervisor or protected from both the hypervisor and all other CVMs. This design simplifies reasoning about memory ownership; however, it fundamentally precludes plaintext data sharing between CVMs because all inter-CVM communication must pass through hypervisor-accessible memory, requiring costly encryption and decryption to preserve confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we introduce CAEC, a system that enables protected memory sharing between CVMs. CAEC builds on Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) and extends its firmware to support Confidential Shared Memory (CSM), a memory region securely shared between multiple CVMs while remaining inaccessible to the hypervisor and all non-participating CVMs. CAEC's design is fully compatible with CCA hardware and introduces only a modest increase (4%) in CCA firmware code size. CAEC delivers substantial performance benefits across a range of workloads. For instance, inter-CVM communication over CAEC achieves up to 209$\times$ reduction in CPU cycles compared to encryption-based mechanisms over hypervisor-accessible shared memory. By combining high performance, strong isolation guarantees, and attestable sharing semantics, CAEC provides a practical and scalable foundation for the next generation of trusted multi-CVM services across both edge and cloud environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing speech enhancement systems, reliant solely on omnidirectional microphones, struggle with ambient noise like competing speakers. To address these issues, we propose VibOmni, a lightweight, end-to-end multi-modal speech enhancement system for earables that leverages bone-conducted vibrations captured by widely available Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). VibOmni integrates a two-branch encoder-decoder deep neural network to fuse audio and vibration features. To overcome the scarcity of paired audio-vibration datasets, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that models Bone Conduction Functions (BCFs) from limited recordings, enabling synthetic vibration data generation with only 4.5% spectrogram similarity error. Additionally, a multi-modal SNR estimator facilitates continual learning and adaptive inference, optimizing performance in dynamic, noisy settings without on-device back-propagation. Evaluated on real-world datasets from 32 volunteers with different devices, VibOmni achieves up to 21% improvement in Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), 26% in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and about 40% WER reduction with much less latency on mobile devices. A user study with 35 participants showed 87% preferred VibOmni over baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for deployment in diverse acoustic environments.</p></details> | Submitted to TMC |

While existing frameworks demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in collaborative problem-solving, they often lack sophisticated mechanisms for parallel execution and dynamic task management. This paper introduces DynTaskMAS, a novel framework that orchestrates asynchronous and parallel operations in LLM-based MAS through dynamic task graphs. The framework features four key innovations: (1) a Dynamic Task Graph Generator that intelligently decomposes complex tasks while maintaining logical dependencies, (2) an Asynchronous Parallel Execution Engine that optimizes resource utilization through efficient task scheduling, (3) a Semantic-Aware Context Management System that enables efficient information sharing among agents, and (4) an Adaptive Workflow Manager that dynamically optimizes system performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DynTaskMAS achieves significant improvements over traditional approaches: a 21-33% reduction in execution time across task complexities (with higher gains for more complex tasks), a 35.4% improvement in resource utilization (from 65% to 88%), and near-linear throughput scaling up to 16 concurrent agents (3.47X improvement for 4X agents). Our framework establishes a foundation for building scalable, high-performance LLM-based multi-agent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic tasks efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Model-enhanced Multiobjective Optimization for Improving Forest Monitoring Efficiency in UAV-enabled Internet-of-Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02370v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely applied for forest monitoring, since the sensor nodes (SNs) in IoT network are low-cost and have computing ability to process the monitoring data. To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\%$ and $9.83\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable.</p></details> |  |

While longer reasoning helps with thorough exploration of solution paths for complex problems, it also often leads to inefficient and redundant outputs--a phenomenon commonly described as overthinking. In this paper, we propose ShorterBetter, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning method that enables reasoning models to learn their own optimal CoT lengths without manual supervision. We define the Sample Optimal Length (SOL) as the length of the shortest correct response among multiple generations, which serves as a dynamic reward signal to guide the model toward efficient reasoning. Applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B as base models, ShorterBetter achieves 50%-80% reduction in output lengths in both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks while maintaining accuracy. Our reasoning trace analysis shows that ShorterBetter refines the structure of the reasoning traces by reducing unnecessary repetition, excessive self-verification, and over-exploration of alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated project website</p></details> |

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels, i.e., normalized probability distributions) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive accuracy. Enhanced ERA resolves the fundamental instability of conventional temperature-based aggregation, ensuring robust control and high performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Limitations of Membership Queries in Testable Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02279v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal. We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner. Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: ITCS 2026</p></details> |

This enables scalable falsification via trace analysis and temporal logic oracles. We demonstrate the approach on a drone control system containing a known safety flaw. The surrogate replicates failure conditions at a fraction of the simulation cost, and a property-guided fuzzer efficiently discovers semantic violations.

| **[Reasoning Up the Instruction Ladder for Controllable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04694v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises ~7K aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks, achieving roughly a 20% improvement on the IHEval conflict setup. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, providing up to a 20% reduction in attack success rate (ASR). These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference, while also removing the flexibility to reduce to simpler systems. We introduce MAS-ZERO, the first self-evolved, inference-time framework for automatic MAS design. MAS-ZERO employs meta-level design to iteratively design, critique, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic problem decomposition and agent composition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness, and reduction to simpler systems when appropriate. Experiments across reasoning (math and graduate-level QA), coding, and agentic (search-based) benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM backbones of varying sizes, demonstrate that MAS-ZERO outperforms strong manual and automatic MAS baselines. It achieves substantial average accuracy improvements of up to 16.69% on reasoning, 16.66% on coding, and 5.45% on agentic tasks, while maintaining cost efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>SEA@N...</summary><p>SEA@NeurIPS (Oral) 2025</p></details> |

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner.

We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, University of Macerata (2025).

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for presentation at a peer-reviewed conference</p></details> |

Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

| **[AI-Driven Optimization under Uncertainty for Mineral Processing Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01977v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global capacity for mineral processing must expand rapidly to meet the demand for critical minerals, which are essential for building the clean energy technologies necessary to mitigate climate change. However, the efficiency of mineral processing is severely limited by uncertainty, which arises from both the variability of feedstock and the complexity of process dynamics. To optimize mineral processing circuits under uncertainty, we introduce an AI-driven approach that formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in handling both feedstock uncertainty and process model uncertainty to optimize the operation of a simulated, simplified flotation cell as an example. We show that by integrating the process of information gathering (i.e., uncertainty reduction) and process optimization, this approach has the potential to consistently perform better than traditional approaches at maximizing an overall objective, such as net present value (NPV). Our methodological demonstration of this optimization-under-uncertainty approach for a synthetic case provides a mathematical and computational framework for later real-world application, with the potential to improve both the laboratory-scale design of experiments and industrial-scale operation of mineral processing circuits without any additional hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Sustainable Earth Resources Communications (SERC)</p></details> |

While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, Project in https://01yzzyu.github.io/script.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning method, on KG link prediction using TransE embeddings on FB15k-237. Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. We observe that the task partitioning strategy affects the magnitude of forgetting: relation-based partitioning (grouping triples by relation type) exhibits 9.8 percentage points higher forgetting than randomly partitioned tasks (12.62% vs 2.81%), suggesting that task construction influences evaluation outcomes. While focused on a single embedding model and dataset, our results demonstrate that EWC effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in KG continual learning and highlight the importance of evaluation protocol design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NORA Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear as Proceedings of the ICM2026, Philadelphia, USA</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Swin Attention Networks for Simultaneously Low-Dose PET and CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06591v5)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety. In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet), which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features, while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise. We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Integer Linear Programming: Explainable Graph-Based Instance Space Analysis in Air Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01698v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |

Traditional keyword-based search methodologies falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss. Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding 200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of 0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Industrial and Goverment Track</p></details> |
| **[Learning Reduced Representations for Quantum Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01509v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context.</p></details> |  |
| **[CourtMotion: Learning Event-Driven Motion Representations from Skeletal Data for Basketball](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01478v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents CourtMotion, a spatiotemporal modeling framework for analyzing and predicting game events and plays as they develop in professional basketball. Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Clustering of Functional Data Via Random Projection Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01450v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering functional data is a challenging task due to intrinsic infinite-dimensionality and the need for stable, data-adaptive partitioning. In this work, we propose a clustering framework based on Random Projections, which simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and generates multiple stochastic representations of the original functions. Each projection is clustered independently, and the resulting partitions are then aggregated through an ensemble consensus procedure, enhancing robustness and mitigating the influence of any single projection. To focus on the most informative representations, projections are ranked according to clustering quality criteria, and only a selected subset is retained. In particular, we adopt Gaussian Mixture Models as base clusterers and employ the Kullback-Leibler divergence to order the random projections; these choices enable fast computation and eliminate the need to specify the number of clusters a priori. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed through an extensive simulation study and two real-data applications, one from spectroscopy data for food authentication and one from log-periodograms of speech recording; the obtained results suggest that the proposal represents an effective tool for the clustering of functional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Fusion and Calibration of Neural Speaker Diarization Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22696v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND) systems produce frame-level probabilistic speaker activity estimates, yet since evaluation focuses primarily on Diarization Error Rate (DER), the reliability and calibration of these confidence scores have been largely neglected. When fusing multiple diarization systems, DOVER-Lap remains the only established approach, operating at the segment level with hard decisions. We propose working with continuous probability outputs, which enables more sophisticated fusion and calibration techniques that can leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing EEND models at the probability level. We investigate two output formulations (multilabel and powerset representations) and their impact on calibration and fusion effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark, we demonstrate that proper calibration provides substantial improvements even for individual models (up to 19% relative DER reduction), in some cases mitigating the absence of domain adaptation. We reveal that joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration, that fusion substantially improves over individual models, and that the Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms both calibrating before fusion and uncalibrated fusion while requiring calibration of only a single combined model. Our best configuration outperforms DOVER-Lap in terms of DER while providing reliable confidence estimates essential for downstream applications. This work proposes best practices for probability-level fusion of EEND systems and demonstrates the advantages of leveraging soft outputs over hard decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-efficient Layer-wise Federated Self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11647v5)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many studies integrate federated learning (FL) with self-supervised learning (SSL) to take advantage of raw data distributed across edge devices. However, edge devices often struggle with high computational and communication costs imposed by SSL and FL algorithms. With the deployment of more complex and large-scale models, these challenges are exacerbated. To tackle this, we propose Layer-Wise Federated Self-Supervised Learning (LW-FedSSL), which allows edge devices to incrementally train a small part of the model at a time. Specifically, in LW-FedSSL, training is decomposed into multiple stages, with each stage responsible for only a specific layer of the model. Since only a portion of the model is active for training at any given time, LW-FedSSL significantly reduces computational requirements. Additionally, only the active model portion needs to be exchanged between the FL server and clients, reducing communication overhead. This enables LW-FedSSL to jointly address both computational and communication challenges of FL client devices. It can achieve up to a $3.34 \times$ reduction in memory usage, $4.20 \times$ fewer computational operations (giga floating point operations, GFLOPs), and a $5.07 \times$ lower communication cost while maintaining performance comparable to its end-to-end training counterpart. Furthermore, we explore a progressive training strategy called Progressive Federated Self-Supervised Learning (Prog-FedSSL), which offers a $1.84\times$ reduction in GFLOPs and a $1.67\times$ reduction in communication costs while maintaining the same memory requirements as end-to-end training. Although the resource efficiency of Prog-FedSSL is lower than that of LW-FedSSL, its performance improvements make it a viable candidate for FL environments with more lenient resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark.

When combined with SGD optimizer, ZO-ASR-SGD fine-tunes ASR models using only inference memory. Our evaluation spans supervised and unsupervised tasks. For Supervised Domain Adaptation on Whisper-Large-V3, ZO-ASR's multiple query mechanism enhances robustness and achieves up to an 18.9\% relative Word Error Rate reduction over zero-shot baselines, outperforming existing ZO methods.

Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.</p></details> |  |

We provide a probabilistic error bound for the randomized warmstart, a stability result for inexact FEAST iterations under general perturbations, and a simple complexity model characterizing the trade-off between initialization cost and solver speedup. Empirically, we demonstrate that RA-FEAST can be more than an order of magnitude faster than standard FEAST while preserving accuracy on sparse Laplacian problems representative of modern spectral methods in statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

To extract information more efficiently for text recognition, document image enhancement and binarization are often employed as preliminary steps in document analysis. Training independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for each color channel can generate images where shadows and noise are effectively removed, which subsequently allows for efficient text information extraction. However, employing multiple GANs for different color channels requires long training and inference times. To reduce both the training and inference times of these preliminary steps, we propose an efficient method based on multi-scale feature extraction, which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation and normalization to process document images before submitting them to GANs for training. Experiment results show that our proposed method significantly reduces both the training and inference times while maintaining comparable performances when benchmarked against the state-of-the-art methods. In the best case scenario, a reduction of 10% and 26% are observed for training and inference times, respectively, while maintaining the model performance at 73.79 of Average-Score metric.

Across 20 model configurations (GPT-4, GPT-5 with varying reasoning effort, and open-weight models) on 100 expert-annotated scripts over 5 runs (500 evaluations), we provide the first comprehensive analysis spanning accuracy, operational reliability, and cost. We introduce the Evaluation Completion Rate (ECR@1) to quantify first-attempt success, revealing reliability from 85.4% to 100.0% with material cost implications via retries. Results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones: GPT-4o Mini attains the best accuracy (6.07 MAAE), high reliability (96.6% ECR@1), and low cost ($1.01 per 1K), yielding a 78x cost reduction vs. GPT-5 (high reasoning) while improving accuracy.

Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.

Factor analytic decompositions express the covariance as a sum of a low rank and diagonal matrix. In practice, Gibbs sampling algorithms are typically used for posterior computation, alternating between updating the latent factors, loadings, and residual variances. In this article, we exploit a blessing of dimensionality to develop a provably accurate posterior approximation for the covariance matrix that bypasses the need for Gibbs or other variants of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Our proposed Factor Analysis with BLEssing of dimensionality (FABLE) approach relies on a first-stage singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the latent factors, and then defines a jointly conjugate prior for the loadings and residual variances. The accuracy of the resulting posterior approximation for the covariance improves with increasing samples as well as increasing dimensionality. We show that FABLE has excellent performance in high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation, including producing well-calibrated credible intervals, both theoretically and through simulation experiments. We also demonstrate the strength of our approach in terms of accurate inference and computational efficiency by applying it to a gene expression dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark of Causal vs Correlation AI for Predictive Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01149v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments presents a challenging optimization problem characterized by extreme cost asymmetry, where missed failures incur costs roughly fifty times higher than false alarms. Conventional machine learning approaches typically optimize statistical accuracy metrics that do not reflect this operational reality and cannot reliably distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations. This study evaluates eight predictive models, ranging from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods, on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with a 3.3% failure prevalence. The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points. These results indicate that causal AI methods, when combined with domain knowledge, can yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Learning Branching Networks for Multitask Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01113v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together. We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs. We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages.

| **[The 4/$δ$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |
| **[On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01067v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vital to the creation of advanced materials is performing structural relaxations. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages, total of 15 pages. 6 tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |

Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\% of the baseline parameters. Our \emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\% to the range 0.03\% to 0.06\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

| **[Safeguarding Privacy in Edge Speech Understanding with Tiny Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01649v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce SpeechShield, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of SpeechShield hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement SpeechShield on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. SpeechShield with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. SpeechShield is 16x smaller in memory, 3.3x faster and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10918v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $Δ< 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.

Recent work remedied this theoretical shortcoming by showing how digital circuits can be presented compositionally as morphisms in a freely generated symmetric traced category. However, this was done informally; in this paper we refine and expand the previous work in several ways, culminating in the presentation of three sound and complete semantics for digital circuits: denotational, operational and algebraic. For the denotational semantics, we establish a correspondence between stream functions with certain properties and circuits constructed syntactically. For the operational semantics, we present the reductions required to model how a circuit processes a value, including the addition of a new reduction for eliminating non-delay-guarded feedback; this leads to an adequate notion of observational equivalence for digital circuits. Finally, we define a new family of equations for translating circuits into bisimilar circuits of a 'normal form', leading to a complete algebraic semantics for sequential circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version, 67 pages</p></details> |

Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving > 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the Huggingface framework, SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASPLOS 2026</p></details> |

Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support. We open-source FlexiWalker in https://github.com/AIS-SNU/FlexiWalker.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EuroSys 2026</p></details> |
| **[MambaScope: Coarse-to-Fine Scoping for Efficient Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00647v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss, as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference. CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing the token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that CF-ViM outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLRREC: Denoising Latent Representations via Multi-Modal Knowledge Fusion in Deep Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00596v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems struggle to effectively utilize the rich, yet high-dimensional and noisy, multi-modal features generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Treating these features as static inputs decouples them from the core recommendation task. We address this limitation with a novel framework built on a key insight: deeply fusing multi-modal and collaborative knowledge for representation denoising. Our unified architecture introduces two primary technical innovations. First, we integrate dimensionality reduction directly into the recommendation model, enabling end-to-end co-training that makes the reduction process aware of the final ranking objective. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the collaborative filtering signal into the latent space. This synergistic process refines raw LLM embeddings, filtering noise while amplifying task-relevant signals. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superior discriminative power, proving that this integrated fusion and denoising strategy is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our work provides a foundational paradigm for effectively harnessing LLMs in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\% and 40.57\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\% compared to the current SOTA method.</p></details> | 17 pages, 19 figures |

This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling. Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2) Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context. (4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights. Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for studying rapid global context learning in the brain.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly used to nowcast quarterly GDP growth, but adoption in high-stakes settings requires that predictive accuracy be matched by interpretability and robust uncertainty quantification. This article reviews recent developments in macroeconomic nowcasting and compares econometric benchmarks with ML approaches in data-rich and shock-prone environments, emphasizing the use of nowcasts as decision inputs rather than as mere error-minimization exercises. The discussion is organized along three axes. First, we contrast penalized regressions, dimension-reduction techniques, tree ensembles, and neural networks with autoregressive models, Dynamic Factor Models, and Random Walks, emphasizing how each family handles small samples, collinearity, mixed frequencies, and regime shifts. Second, we examine explainability tools (intrinsic measures and model-agnostic XAI methods), focusing on temporal stability, sign coherence, and their ability to sustain credible economic narratives and nowcast revisions. Third, we analyze non-parametric uncertainty quantification via block bootstrapping for predictive intervals and confidence bands on feature importance under serial dependence and ragged edge. We translate these elements into a reference workflow for "decision-grade" nowcasting systems, including vintage management, time-aware validation, and automated reliability audits, and we outline a research agenda on regime-dependent model comparison, bootstrap design for latent components, and temporal stability of explanations. Explainable ML and uncertainty quantification emerge as structural components of a responsible forecasting pipeline, not optional refinements.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure.

| **[Multi-Task Temporal Fusion Transformer for Joint Sales and Inventory Forecasting in Amazon E-Commerce Supply Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00370v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient inventory management and accurate sales forecasting are critical challenges in large-scale e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, where stockouts and overstocking can lead to substantial financial losses and operational inefficiencies. Traditional single-task forecasting models, which focus solely on sales or inventory, often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and cross-task interactions that characterize real-world supply chain dynamics. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Task Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT-MTL) framework designed for joint sales and inventory forecasting within the Amazon e-commerce ecosystem. The model integrates heterogeneous data sources, including historical sales records, warehouse inventory levels, pricing, promotions, and event-driven factors such as holidays and Prime Day campaigns, through a unified deep learning architecture. A shared encoder captures long-term temporal patterns, while task-specific decoder heads predict sales volume, inventory turnover, and stockout probability simultaneously. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TFT-MTL model significantly outperforms baseline methods such as LSTM, GRU, and single-task TFT. Compared with the single-task TFT model, the proposed approach achieves a 6.2% reduction in Sales RMSE, a 12.7% decrease in Sales MAPE, a 6.4% reduction in Inventory RMSE, and a 12.4% decrease in Inventory MAPE. These results confirm the model's ability to effectively capture multi-dimensional dependencies across supply chain variables. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, data-driven decision support tool for optimizing Amazon's inventory scheduling and demand planning strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting and Sampling Traces in Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00314v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the problems of counting and sampling Mazurkiewicz traces that a regular language touches. Fix an alphabet $Σ$ and an independence relation $\mathbb{I} \subseteq Σ\times Σ$. The input consists of a regular language $L \subseteq Σ^*$, given by a finite automaton with $m$ states, and a natural number $n$ (in unary). For the counting problem, the goal is to compute the number of Mazurkiewicz traces (induced by $\mathbb{I}$) that intersect the $n^\text{th}$ slice $L_n = L \cap Σ^n$, i.e., traces that admit at least one linearization in $L_n$. For the sampling problem, the goal is to output a trace drawn from a distribution that is approximately uniform over all such traces. These tasks are motivated by bounded model checking with partial-order reduction, where an \emph{a priori} estimate of the reduced state space is valuable, and by testing methods for concurrent programs that use partial-order-aware random exploration. We first show that the counting problem is #P-hard even when $L$ is accepted by a deterministic automaton, in sharp contrast to counting words of a DFA, which is polynomial-time solvable. We then prove that the problem lies in #P for both NFAs and DFAs, irrespective of whether $L$ is trace-closed. Our main algorithmic contributions are a \emph{fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme} (FPRAS) that, with high probability, approximates the desired count within a prescribed accuracy, and a \emph{fully polynomial-time almost uniform sampler} (FPAUS) that generates traces whose distribution is provably close to uniform.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in POPL 2026.

| **[Adversarial Signed Graph Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00307v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs with positive and negative edges can model complex relationships in social networks. Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Modeling and Correction of Vehicle Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00289v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a data-driven framework for learning and correcting non-autonomous vehicle dynamics. Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity.</p></details> |  |

Although Angular 17 introduced a unified, signal-first model, most enterprise codebases still rely heavily on legacy RxJS patterns that create unpredictable update flows, memory leaks, and excessive change cycles. To address these issues, we developed ng-reactive-lint, a deterministic static analysis tool that understands Angular's component semantics, lifecycle hooks, template bindings, and reactivity patterns. Unlike generic ESLint or RxJS plugins, ng-reactive-lint performs framework-aware analysis to detect high-impact anti-patterns and provide actionable, context-specific fixes. Evaluation across five large real-world projects showed reductions of up to threefold in unnecessary change detection cycles and up to 75% lower peak memory usage. The tool offers a practical, automated path to adopting modern Angular reactivity at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for ACL 2026</p></details> |

We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to the sensitive reference texts. It interprets sampling from the LLM's next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling without any privacy cost from a small superset of the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent $8\times$ (or more) reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. InvisibleInk is able to generate, for the first time, high-quality private long-form text at less than $4$-$8\times$ times the computation cost of non-private generation, paving the way for its practical use. We open-source a pip-installable Python package (invink) for InvisibleInk at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/invisibleink.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The Price of Progress: Algorithmic Efficiency and the Falling Cost of AI Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23455v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benchmarks to date. We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\times$ to $10\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\times$ per year. Finally, we recommend that evaluators both publicize and take into account the price of benchmarking as an essential part of measuring the real-world impact of AI.</p></details> |  |

Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications. The bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator has applications ranging from building automation controls to lightweight actuation systems for space robotics and medical prosthesis.</p></details> |  |

We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover.

| **[OBLR-PO: A Theoretical Framework for Stable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23310v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training methods for large language models have advanced rapidly, yet their design has largely been guided by heuristics rather than systematic theoretical principles. This gap limits our understanding of the properties of the gradient estimators and the associated optimization algorithms, thereby constraining opportunities to improve training stability and overall performance. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients. We further show that the variance-optimal baseline is a gradient-weighted estimator, offering a new principle for variance reduction and naturally enhancing stability beyond existing methods. These insights motivate Optimal Baseline and Learning-Rate Policy Optimization (OBLR-PO), an algorithm that jointly adapts learning rates and baselines in a theoretically grounded manner. Experiments on Qwen3-4B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base demonstrate consistent gains over existing policy optimization methods, validating that our theoretical contributions translate into practical improvements in large-scale post-training.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3% in precision and up to 22.3% in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, most MCMC algorithms are inherently sequential and their time complexity scales linearly with the sequence length. Previous work on adapting MCMC to modern hardware has therefore focused on running many independent chains in parallel. Here, we take an alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in parallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for parallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence as a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a parallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to parallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the simulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of parallel Newton iterations. Additionally, we develop two new parallel quasi-Newton methods to evaluate nonlinear recursions with lower memory costs and reduced runtime. We find that the proposed parallel algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling across multiple examples, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude compared to sequential evaluation.</p></details> | 36 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Joint Distillation for Fast Likelihood Evaluation and Sampling in Flow-based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02636v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic Structure as a Proxy for Saliency: SVD-Based Weight Preservation for Mixed-Precision Quantization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01343v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable. In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\%) and SpQR (65.34\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.</p></details> |  |
| **[SQLBarber: A System Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Customized and Realistic SQL Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06192v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2026; extended version with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02333v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Here, $\mathsf{u}$ is a scalar function with inverse $\mathsf{s}$, $x^{\ft}\barx$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing of vectors $x, \barx$ belonging to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We compute explicitly the MTW tensor (or cross curvature) for the optimal transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with this cost. The condition that the MTW-tensor vanishes on null vectors under the Kim-McCann metric is a fourth-order nonlinear ODE, which could be reduced to a linear ODE of the form $\mathsf{s}^{(2)} - S\mathsf{s}^{(1)} + P\mathsf{s} = 0$ with constant coefficients $P$ and $S$. The resulting inverse functions include {\it Lambert} and {\it generalized inverse hyperbolic\slash trigonometric} functions. The square Euclidean metric and $\log$-type costs are equivalent to instances of these solutions. The optimal map may be written explicitly in terms of the potential function. For cost functions of a similar form on a hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space and unit sphere, we also express this tensor in terms of algebraic expressions in derivatives of $\mathsf{s}$ using the Gauss-Codazzi equation, obtaining new families of strictly regular costs for these manifolds, including new families of {\it power function costs}. We express the divergence geometry of the $\mathsf{c}$-divergence in terms of the Kim-McCann metric, including a $\mathsf{c}$-Crouzeix identity and a formula for the primal connection. We analyze the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost, providing examples of $\mathsf{c}$-convex functions, which are used to construct a new \emph{local form} of the $α$-divergences on probability simplices. We apply the optimal maps to sample the multivariate $t$-distribution.</p></details> | 40 pages |
| **[Improved Disease Outbreak Detection from Out-of-sequence measurements Using Markov-switching Fixed-lag Particle Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01639v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle filters (PFs) have become an essential tool for disease surveillance, as they can estimate hidden epidemic states in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. In epidemic modelling, population dynamics may be governed by distinct regimes such as endemic or outbreak phases which can be represented using Markov-switching state-space models. In many real-world surveillance systems, data often arrives with delays or in the wrong temporal order, producing out-of-sequence (OOS) measurements that pertain to past time points rather than the current one. While existing PF methods can incorporate OOS measurements through particle reweighting, these approaches are limited in their ability to fully adjust past latent trajectories. To address this, we introduce a Markov-switching fixed-lag particle filter (FL-PF) that resimulates particle trajectories within a user-specified lag window, allowing OOS measurements to retroactively update both state and model estimates. By explicitly reevaluating historical samples, the FL-PF improves the accuracy and timeliness of outbreak detection and reduces false alarms. We also show how to compute the log-likelihood within the FL-PF framework, enabling parameter estimation using Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$). Together, these contributions extend the applicability of PFs to surveillance systems where retrospective data are common, offering a more robust framework for monitoring disease outbreaks and parameter inference.</p></details> | 23 Pages |
| **[Efficient Hyperparameter Search for Non-Stationary Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01258v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online learning is the cornerstone of applications like recommendation and advertising systems, where models continuously adapt to shifting data distributions. Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.</p></details> |  |

We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\text{Re}\in\{10, 15, 20\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids. The approach is general and applicable to other explicit solvers requiring GPU-resident geometry embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 31 figures, 9 tables, 6 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01081v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>add a...</summary><p>add an author[Update], 12 pages, 5 figures, accepted at LAW 2025 Workshop (NeurIPS 2025) Project page: https://deeppersona-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach consistently improves upon the Hadamard transform for common formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20950v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to time-consuming Gaussian process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the GP update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that PFNs are backbone architecture invariant and the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN, RNN and LSTM-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of E-03, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[City-Conditioned Memory for Multi-City Traffic and Mobility Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00851v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes. We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks). Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638v4)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two cases of such divergences: "harmless" divergences that occur in the behavioral null-space of the layer(s) of interest, and "pernicious" divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we apply and modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) allowing representations from causal interventions to remain closer to the natural distribution, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of the interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMamDiff: Spatial Mamba for Stochastic Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00355v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With intelligent room-side sensing and service robots widely deployed, human motion prediction (HMP) is essential for safe, proactive assistance. However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting and Sampling Traces in Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00314v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the problems of counting and sampling Mazurkiewicz traces that a regular language touches. Fix an alphabet $Σ$ and an independence relation $\mathbb{I} \subseteq Σ\times Σ$. The input consists of a regular language $L \subseteq Σ^*$, given by a finite automaton with $m$ states, and a natural number $n$ (in unary). For the counting problem, the goal is to compute the number of Mazurkiewicz traces (induced by $\mathbb{I}$) that intersect the $n^\text{th}$ slice $L_n = L \cap Σ^n$, i.e., traces that admit at least one linearization in $L_n$. For the sampling problem, the goal is to output a trace drawn from a distribution that is approximately uniform over all such traces. These tasks are motivated by bounded model checking with partial-order reduction, where an \emph{a priori} estimate of the reduced state space is valuable, and by testing methods for concurrent programs that use partial-order-aware random exploration. We first show that the counting problem is #P-hard even when $L$ is accepted by a deterministic automaton, in sharp contrast to counting words of a DFA, which is polynomial-time solvable. We then prove that the problem lies in #P for both NFAs and DFAs, irrespective of whether $L$ is trace-closed. Our main algorithmic contributions are a \emph{fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme} (FPRAS) that, with high probability, approximates the desired count within a prescribed accuracy, and a \emph{fully polynomial-time almost uniform sampler} (FPAUS) that generates traces whose distribution is provably close to uniform.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in POPL 2026.

A poorly selected polynomial order results in over- or under-smoothing which shows as either bias or excessive noise at the output. In this study, we apply the N-fold cross-validation technique (also known as leave-one-out cross-validation) for model order selection and show that the inherent analytical structure of the SG filtering problem, mainly its minimum norm formulation, enables an efficient and effective order selection solution. More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method. The suggested solution compares favorably with the state-of-the-art Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) rule in non-asymptotic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sample size regimes.

| **[Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steady-State Drifting Equilibrium Analysis of Single-Track Two-Wheeled Robots for Controller Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09134v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drifting is an advanced driving technique where the wheeled robot's tire-ground interaction breaks the common non-holonomic pure rolling constraint. This allows high-maneuverability tasks like quick cornering, and steady-state drifting control enhances motion stability under lateral slip conditions. While drifting has been successfully achieved in four-wheeled robot systems, its application to single-track two-wheeled (STTW) robots, such as unmanned motorcycles or bicycles, has not been thoroughly studied. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the drifting equilibrium theory to STTW robots and reveals the mechanism behind the steady-state drifting maneuver. Notably, the counter-steering drifting technique used by skilled motorcyclists is explained through this theory. In addition, an analytical algorithm based on intrinsic geometry and kinematics relationships is proposed, reducing the computation time by four orders of magnitude while maintaining less than 6% error compared to numerical methods. Based on equilibrium analysis, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to achieve steady-state drifting and equilibrium points transition, with its effectiveness and robustness validated through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Standard calibration metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the forecast quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

| **[Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $τ$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $τ$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $θ$-Trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GSM8K-level math-reasoning, GPT-2-level text, and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints, with consistent performance gains across models ranging from 200M to 8B.

| **[Test Time Training for AC Power Flow Surrogates via Physics and Operational Constraint Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22343v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Collapse of Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22281v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[The Evolution of Trust under Institutional Moral Hazard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21875v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of for-profit institutions that broadcast reputations to foster trust among market participants. We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system. These findings highlight the intricate tensions between platform incentives and resulting social utility for marketplace participants.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

While edge-based MPNNs effectively capture local interactions, their expressive power is theoretically bounded, limiting the discovery of higher-order relationships. We introduce the Higher-Order Graph Attention (HoGA) module, which constructs a k-order attention matrix by sampling subgraphs to maximize diversity among feature vectors. Unlike existing higher-order attention methods that greedily resample similar k-order relationships, HoGA targets diverse modalities in higher-order topology, reducing redundancy and expanding the range of captured substructures. Applied to two single-hop attention models, HoGA achieves at least a 5% accuracy gain on all benchmark node classification datasets and outperforms recent baselines on six of eight datasets.

Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[LFaB: Low fidelity as Bias for Active Learning in the chemical configuration space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15577v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning promises to provide an optimal training sample selection procedure in the construction of machine learning models. It often relies on minimizing the model's variance, which is assumed to decrease the prediction error. Still, it is frequently even less efficient than pure random sampling. Motivated by the bias-variance decomposition, we propose to minimize the model's bias instead of its variance. By doing so, we are able to almost exactly match the best-case error over all possible greedy sample selection procedures for a relevant application. Our bias approximation is based on using cheap to calculate low fidelity data as known from $Δ$-ML or multifidelity machine learning. We exemplify our approach for a wider class of applications in quantum chemistry including predicting excitation energies and ab initio potential energy surfaces. Here, the proposed method reduces training data consumption by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard active learning.</p></details> | SI included in main |
| **[A Surrogate-Informed Framework for Sparse Grid Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20187v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximating complex, high-dimensional, and computationally expensive functions is a central problem in science and engineering. Standard sparse grids offer a powerful solution by mitigating the curse of dimensionality compared to full tensor grids. However, they treat all regions of the domain isotropically, which may not be efficient for functions with localized or anisotropic behavior. This work presents a surrogate-informed framework for constructing sparse grid interpolants, which is guided by an error indicator that serves as a zero-cost estimate for the hierarchical surplus. This indicator is calculated for all candidate points, defined as those in the next-level grid $w+1$ not already present in the base grid $w$. It quantifies the local approximation error by measuring the relative difference between the predictions of two consecutive interpolants of level $w$ and $w-1$. The candidates are then ranked by this metric to select the most impactful points for refinement up to a given budget or following another criterion, as, e.g., a given threshold in the error indicator. The final higher-order model is then constructed using a surrogate-informed approach: the objective function is evaluated only at the selected high-priority points, while for the remaining nodes of the $w+1$ grid, we assign the values predicted by the initial $w$-level surrogate. This strategy significantly reduces the required number of expensive evaluations, yielding a final model that closely approximates the accuracy of a fully-resolved $w+1$ grid at a fraction of the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed surrogate-informed refinement criterion is demonstrated for several analytic function and for a real engineering problem, i.e., the analysis of sensitivity to geometrical parameters of numerically predicted flashback phenomenon in hydrogen-fueled perforated burners.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSI Prediction Frameworks for Enhanced 5G Link Adaptation: Performance-Complexity Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20160v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is fundamental for efficient link adaptation. However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE).</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4x and 3.85x lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Learning at Machine Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19980v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03827v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings, BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems, SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the runtime by at least an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>An op...</summary><p>An open-source implementation of SNBO is available at: https://github.com/ComputationalDesignLab/snbo</p></details> |
| **[Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19364v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Biosecurity Safeguards for Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19114v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables,</p></details> |
| **[VALUE: Value-Aware Large Language Model for Query Rewriting via Weighted Trie in Sponsored Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05321v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-to-bidword(i.e., bidding keyword) rewriting is fundamental to sponsored search, transforming noisy user queries into semantically relevant and commercially valuable keywords. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) improve semantic relevance through generative retrieval frameworks, but they rarely encode the commercial value of keywords. As a result, rewrites are often semantically correct yet economically suboptimal, and a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stage is usually added after supervised fine-tuning(SFT) to mitigate this deficiency. However, conventional preference alignment frequently overemphasize the ordering of bidword values and is susceptible to overfitting, which degrades rewrite quality. In addition, bidword value changes rapidly, while existing generative methods do not respond to these fluctuations. To address this shortcoming, we introduce VALUE(Value-Aware Large language model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), a framework that integrates value awareness directly into generation and enhances value alignment during training. VALUE employs the Weighted Trie, a novel variant of the classical trie that stores real-time value signals for each token. During decoding, the framework adjusts the LLM's token probabilities with these signals, constraining the search space and steering generation toward high-value rewrites. The alignment stage uses a fine-grained preference learning strategy that emphasizes stable, high-value differences and down-weights noisy or transient fluctuations, thereby improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Offline experiments show that VALUE significantly outperforms baselines in both semantic matching and value-centric metrics. VALUE has been deployed on our advertising system since October 2024 and served the Double Eleven promotions, the biggest shopping carnival in China.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Benefit of Curriculum in Transformer Tree-Reasoning Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07372v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck. To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.</p></details> |  |

Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Existing methods provide partial solutions but suffer from notable limitations: model-centric approaches, such as sampling and aggregation, often struggle with generalization, while data-centric techniques, including graph sparsification and coarsening, lead to information loss and ineffective handling of bipartite graph structures. Recent advances in graph condensation offer a promising direction by reducing graph size while preserving essential information, presenting a novel approach to mitigating these challenges. Inspired by the principles of democracy, we propose \textbf{DemoRec}, a framework that leverages graph condensation to generate user and item representatives for recommendation tasks. By constructing a compact interaction graph and clustering nodes with shared characteristics from the original graph, DemoRec significantly reduces graph size and computational complexity. Furthermore, it mitigates the over-reliance on high-order information, a critical challenge in large-scale bipartite graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DemoRec, showcasing substantial improvements in recommendation performance, computational efficiency, and robustness compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

| **[The Moral Consistency Pipeline: Continuous Ethical Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03026v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.</p></details> |  |

An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems. Understanding the evolutionary pressures introduced by AI-mediated software production is critical for anticipating broader patterns of cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is a contributed chapter to the SFI edited volume: The Economy as a Complex Evolving System, Part IV (2025)</p></details> |

We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |

Traditional SLAM systems typically assume a static world or treat dynamic as outliers, discarding their information to preserve map consistency. As a result, they cannot exploit dynamic entities as persistent landmarks, do not model and exploit their motion over time, and therefore quickly degrade in highly cluttered environments with few reliable static features. This paper presents a novel 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic entities into the SLAM backend. Our framework incorporates semantic motion priors and dynamic entity-aware constraints to jointly optimize the robot trajectory, dynamic entity poses, and the surrounding environment structure within a unified graph formulation. In parallel, a dynamic keyframe selection policy and a semantic loop-closure prefiltering step enable the system to remain robust and effective in highly dynamic environments by continuously adapting to scene changes and filtering inconsistent observations. The simulation and real-world experimental results show a 49.97% reduction in ATE compared to the baseline method employed, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating dynamic entities and estimating their poses for improved robustness and richer scene representation in complex scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

Nevertheless, despite these climate conditions being meaningful for several research and practical applications, our understanding of weather dynamics remains limited. The available meteorological data from 1969 to 2016 is analogical, which presents a significant challenge to analyze because these records are riddled with missing values, some measurements were taken at irregular measuring intervals, making it an interesting puzzle to grasp the Antofagasta's climate scenario. To overcome this issue, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity time series. Our analytical approach involves the q-triplet calculation method, serving as a powerful tool to identify distinctive behavior within systems under non-equilibrium states. Our results suggest that, in general, the q-triplet values satisfy the condition $q_\text{sens}<1<q_\text{stat}<q_\text{rel}$, a pattern that has been observed in previous studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1, table, 3 figures, International Workshop of Statistical Physics</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Definitions of Quality and Diversity in Sonic Measurement Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02783v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital sound synthesis presents the opportunity to explore vast parameter spaces containing millions of configurations. Quality diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to harness this potential, yet their success hinges on appropriate sonic feature representations. Existing QD methods predominantly employ handcrafted descriptors or supervised classifiers, potentially introducing unintended exploration biases and constraining discovery to familiar sonic regions. This work investigates unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for automatically defining and dynamically reconfiguring sonic behaviour spaces during QD search. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders to project high-dimensional audio features onto structured grids for MAP-Elites, implementing dynamic reconfiguration through model retraining at regular intervals. Comparison across two experimental scenarios shows that automatic approaches achieve significantly greater diversity than handcrafted behaviour spaces while avoiding expert-imposed biases. Dynamic behaviour-space reconfiguration maintains evolutionary pressure and prevents stagnation, with PCA proving most effective among the dimensionality reduction techniques. These results contribute to automated sonic discovery systems capable of exploring vast parameter spaces without manual intervention or supervised training constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogDrive: Cognition-Driven Multimodal Prediction-Planning Fusion for Safe Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02777v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires a unified understanding of multimodal interactions and dynamic planning under uncertainty. Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Self-Improving AI Agents through Self-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02731v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow. The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough. We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoMAE: Masking Representation Learning for Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14083v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of missing data in urban intelligence systems, attributable to adverse environmental conditions and equipment failures, poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of downstream applications, notably in the realms of traffic forecasting and energy consumption prediction. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist. Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks. Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem. Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model. The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Distributed and Autonomic Minimum Spanning Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02683v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The most common strategy for enabling a process in a distributed system to broadcast a message is one-to-all communication. However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast. Simulation results are provided, including comparisons with other alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint is an English translation and slightly extended version of the paper published in Portuguese at the 32nd Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems (2014), reference [1]</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Single-Agent Safety: A Taxonomy of Risks in LLM-to-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02682v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines why safety mechanisms designed for human-model interaction do not scale to environments where large language models (LLMs) interact with each other. Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-User Personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction: Resolving Preference Conflicts Using Gradual Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03576v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to a journal</p></details> |
| **[Agentic UAVs: LLM-Driven Autonomy with Integrated Tool-Calling and Cognitive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13352v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in defense, surveillance, and disaster response, yet most systems still operate at SAE Level 2 to 3 autonomy. Their dependence on rule-based control and narrow AI limits adaptability in dynamic and uncertain missions. Current UAV architectures lack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and integration with external systems. Importantly, none make use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents with tool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic UAVs framework, a five-layer architecture consisting of Perception, Reasoning, Action, Integration, and Learning. The framework enhances UAV autonomy through LLM-driven reasoning, database querying, and interaction with third-party systems. A prototype built with ROS 2 and Gazebo combines YOLOv11 for object detection with GPT-4 for reasoning and a locally deployed Gemma 3 model. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved higher detection confidence (0.79 compared to 0.72), improved person detection rates (91% compared to 75%), and a major increase in correct action recommendations (92% compared to 4.5%). These results show that modest computational overhead can enable significantly higher levels of autonomy and system-level integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figure |

This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This provides insights into the decision-making process for each case, which makes DFS especially significant in settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions. However, existing DFS methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in real-life scenarios. DFS also introduces new own sources of uncertainty compared to the static setting, which is also not considered in the existing literature. In this paper, we formalize the additional sources of uncertainty in DFS, and give formulas to estimate them. We also propose novel approach by leveraging a rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach against established and state-of-the-art greedy and reinforcement learning methods, which are mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rulebased system.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed generative agent EZYer : 1) Teacher Module: Integrating the Text Corpus retrieval and in-depth generation technologies, it automatically generates structured teaching materials and LaTeX Beamer courseware in line with the high school mathematics syllabus and supports user-defined image insertion. 2) Student Module: Throughout the collaborative interaction of the four roles of Teacher, Assistant, Top Student and Struggling Student, Note Taker summarizes and generates academic notes to enhance the depth and interest of learning. 3) Controller: set up keyword filtering system, content scoring system, role co-validation system, and dynamic content correction system. This ensure academic strictness and pedagogical propriety of EZYer inputs and outputs. In order to evaluate EZYer, this paper designs five-dimensional evaluation indexes of content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting correctness and visual design and appeal, and scores 100 Beamer and Notes generated by EZYer by five large language models, separately, and the results show that the quality of EZYer-generated content is excellent and has a good application prospect.</p></details> | AgentIR@SIGIR 2025 |

Existing approaches typically follow an inductive paradigm, where researchers train static models on historical data for popularity prediction. However, the UGC propagation is inherently a dynamic process, and static modeling based on historical features fails to capture the complex interactions and nonlinear evolution. In this paper, we propose PopSim, a novel simulation-based paradigm for social media popularity prediction (SMPP). Unlike the inductive paradigm, PopSim leverages the large language models (LLMs)-based multi-agent social network sandbox to simulate UGC propagation dynamics for popularity prediction. Specifically, to effectively model the UGC propagation process in the network, we design a social-mean-field-based agent interaction mechanism, which models the dual-channel and bidirectional individual-population interactions, enhancing agents' global perception and decision-making capabilities. In addition, we propose a multi-source information aggregation module that transforms heterogeneous social metadata into a uniform formulation for LLMs. Finally, propagation dynamics with multimodal information are fused to provide comprehensive popularity prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SimPop consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, reducing prediction error by an average of 8.82%, offering a new perspective for research on the SMPP task.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |

Existing speech enhancement systems, reliant solely on omnidirectional microphones, struggle with ambient noise like competing speakers. To address these issues, we propose VibOmni, a lightweight, end-to-end multi-modal speech enhancement system for earables that leverages bone-conducted vibrations captured by widely available Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). VibOmni integrates a two-branch encoder-decoder deep neural network to fuse audio and vibration features. To overcome the scarcity of paired audio-vibration datasets, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that models Bone Conduction Functions (BCFs) from limited recordings, enabling synthetic vibration data generation with only 4.5% spectrogram similarity error. Additionally, a multi-modal SNR estimator facilitates continual learning and adaptive inference, optimizing performance in dynamic, noisy settings without on-device back-propagation. Evaluated on real-world datasets from 32 volunteers with different devices, VibOmni achieves up to 21% improvement in Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), 26% in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and about 40% WER reduction with much less latency on mobile devices. A user study with 35 participants showed 87% preferred VibOmni over baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for deployment in diverse acoustic environments.</p></details> | Submitted to TMC |
| **[Simulation and inference methods for non-Markovian stochastic biochemical reaction networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02478v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks are widely used to capture intrinsic noise in cellular systems. The typical formulation of these models are based on Markov processes for which there is extensive research on efficient simulation and inference. However, there are biological processes, such as gene transcription and translation, that introduce history dependent dynamics requiring non-Markovian processes to accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the system. This greater realism comes with additional computational challenges for simulation and parameter inference. We develop efficient stochastic simulation algorithms for well-mixed non-Markovian stochastic biochemical reaction networks with delays that depend on system state and time. Our methods generalize the next reaction method and $τ$-leaping method to support arbitrary inter-event time distributions while preserving computational scalability. We also introduce a coupling scheme to generate exact non-Markovian sample paths that are positively correlated to an approximate non-Markovian $τ$-leaping sample path. This enables substantial computational gains for Bayesian inference of model parameters though multifidelity simulation-based inference schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a gene regulation model with delayed auto-inhibition, showing substantial gains in both simulation accuracy and inference efficiency of two orders of magnitude. These results extend the practical applicability of non-Markovian models in systems biology and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Self-Evolving LLMs with Minimal Human Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02472v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological systems where roles naturally emerge to enable coordination, role-based MARL methods have been proposed to enhance cooperation learning for complex tasks. However, existing methods exclusively derive roles from an agent's past experience during training, neglecting their influence on its future trajectories. This paper introduces a key insight: an agent's role should shape its future behavior to enable effective coordination. Hence, we propose Role Discovery and Diversity through Dynamics Models (R3DM), a novel role-based MARL framework that learns emergent roles by maximizing the mutual information between agents' roles, observed trajectories, and expected future behaviors. R3DM optimizes the proposed objective through contrastive learning on past trajectories to first derive intermediate roles that shape intrinsic rewards to promote diversity in future behaviors across different roles through a learned dynamics model. Benchmarking on SMAC and SMACv2 environments demonstrates that R3DM outperforms state-of-the-art MARL approaches, improving multi-agent coordination to increase win rates by up to 20%.

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02457v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models.

To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3, a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts, complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation standards.</p></details> |  |

In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

It is prevalent in various physical and mechanical systems, such as yielding structures under seismic excitation, ferromagnetic materials, and piezoelectric actuators. Analytical models like the Bouc-Wen model are often employed but rely on idealized assumptions and careful parameter calibration, limiting their applicability to diverse or mechanism-unknown behaviors. Existing equation discovery approaches for hysteresis are often system-specific or rely on predefined model libraries, which limit their flexibility and ability to capture the hidden mechanisms. To address these, this research develops a unified framework that integrates learning of internal variables (commonly used in modeling hysteresis) and symbolic regression to automatically extract internal hysteretic variable, and discover explicit governing equations directly from data without predefined libraries as required by methods such as sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Solving the discovered equations naturally enables prediction of the dynamic responses of hysteretic systems. This work provides a systematic view and approach for both equation discovery and characterization of hysteretic dynamics, defining a unified framework for these types of problems.</p></details> |  |

While existing frameworks demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in collaborative problem-solving, they often lack sophisticated mechanisms for parallel execution and dynamic task management. This paper introduces DynTaskMAS, a novel framework that orchestrates asynchronous and parallel operations in LLM-based MAS through dynamic task graphs. The framework features four key innovations: (1) a Dynamic Task Graph Generator that intelligently decomposes complex tasks while maintaining logical dependencies, (2) an Asynchronous Parallel Execution Engine that optimizes resource utilization through efficient task scheduling, (3) a Semantic-Aware Context Management System that enables efficient information sharing among agents, and (4) an Adaptive Workflow Manager that dynamically optimizes system performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DynTaskMAS achieves significant improvements over traditional approaches: a 21-33% reduction in execution time across task complexities (with higher gains for more complex tasks), a 35.4% improvement in resource utilization (from 65% to 88%), and near-linear throughput scaling up to 16 concurrent agents (3.47X improvement for 4X agents). Our framework establishes a foundation for building scalable, high-performance LLM-based multi-agent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic tasks efficiently.</p></details> |  |

We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Truthful and Trustworthy IoT AI Agents via Immediate-Penalty Enforcement under Approximate VCG Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00513v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of autonomous AI agents in Internet of Things (IoT) energy systems requires decision-making mechanisms that remain robust, efficient, and trustworthy under real-time constraints and imperfect monitoring. While reinforcement learning enables adaptive prosumer behaviors, ensuring economic consistency and preventing strategic manipulation remain open challenges, particularly when sensing noise or partial observability reduces the operator's ability to verify actions. This paper introduces a trust-enforcement framework for IoT energy trading that combines an approximate Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) double auction with an immediate one-shot penalty. Unlike reputation- or history-based approaches, the proposed mechanism restores truthful reporting within a single round, even when allocation accuracy is approximate and monitoring is noisy. We theoretically characterize the incentive gap induced by approximation and derive a penalty threshold that guarantees truthful bidding under bounded sensing errors. To evaluate learning-enabled prosumers, we embed the mechanism into a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment reflecting stochastic generation, dynamic loads, and heterogeneous trading opportunities. Experiments show that improved allocation accuracy reduces deviation incentives, the required penalty matches analytical predictions, and learned bidding behaviors remain stable and interpretable despite imperfect monitoring. These results demonstrate that lightweight penalty designs can reliably align strategic IoT agents with socially efficient energy-trading outcomes.</p></details> |  |
