| **[Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Entropy stable finite difference (ESFD) methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity (ECAV) and knapsack limiting (KL) techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Learning for Deep Learning-Based Hemodynamic Parameter Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03453v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hemodynamic parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress play an important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in cardiovascular diseases. These parameters can be accurately computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive. Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained. These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to difficult cases. Our results show that active learning is a feasible strategy to increase the potential of deep learning-based CFD surrogates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep vectorised operators for pulsatile hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries from a steady-state prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11920v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in silico. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation-independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure (approximation disparity 0.368 $\pm$ 0.079) while being agnostic ($p < 0.05$ in a one-way ANOVA test) to re-sampling of the source domain, i.e. discretisation-independent. This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine"</p></details> |
| **[Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Discovery and Formulation Refines the Quasi-Steady Model of Flapping-Wing Aerodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18703v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology, physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs: high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models, we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Improving Long-term Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Predictions: A Proof of Concept with Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18565v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost. Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Transformers for Mesh-Based Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18051v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

| **[Beyond Blur: A Fluid Perspective on Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16827v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 main conference, 8 pages paper, 20 pages appendix, 24 figures, supplementary pseudocode in appendix, https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/1176</p></details> |
| **[The compressible Neural Particle Method for Simulating Compressible Viscous Fluid Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16916v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking. However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks. The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step, and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility. The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PASJ</p></details> |
| **[OpenLB-UQ: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Incompressible Fluid Flow Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13867v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in computational fluid dynamics to assess the reliability and robustness of simulations, given the uncertainties in input parameters. OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fluid Dynamics and Domain Reconstruction from Noisy Flow Images Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Quasi-Conformal Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11216v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive AI and Human Behavior: Challenges and Pathways for AI Governance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16608v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Generative AI systems increasingly engage in long-term, personal, and relational interactions, human-AI engagements are becoming significantly complex, making them more challenging to understand and govern. These Interactive AI systems adapt to users over time, build ongoing relationships, and even can take proactive actions on behalf of users. This new paradigm requires us to rethink how such human-AI interactions can be studied effectively to inform governance and policy development. In this paper, we draw on insights from a collaborative interdisciplinary workshop with policymakers, behavioral scientists, Human-Computer Interaction researchers, and civil society practitioners, to identify challenges and methodological opportunities arising within new forms of human-AI interactions. Based on these insights, we discuss an outcome-focused regulatory approach that integrates behavioral insights to address both the risks and benefits of emerging human-AI relationships. In particular, we emphasize the need for new methods to study the fluid, dynamic, and context-dependent nature of these interactions. We provide practical recommendations for developing human-centric AI governance, informed by behavioral insights, that can respond to the complexities of Interactive AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of AAAI/ACM Conference AIES 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniFluids: Physics Pre-trained Modeling of Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10862v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) drives progress in numerous scientific and engineering fields, yet high-fidelity simulations remain computationally prohibitive. While machine learning approaches offer computing acceleration, they typically specialize in single physical systems or require extensive training data, hindering their applicability in highly nonlinear and 3D flow scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniFluids, a pure physics pre-trained model that captures fundamental fluid dynamics laws and adapts efficiently to diverse downstream tasks with minimal data. We develop a training framework combining physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. This enables OmniFluids to retain broad physics knowledge while delivering fast and accurate predictions. Architecturally, OmniFluids integrates a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, seamlessly incorporating physics-based supervision while allowing efficient and scalable modeling of diverse tasks. Extensive tests on a broad range of 2D and 3D benchmarks show that OmniFluids outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in terms of flow field prediction and turbulence statistics. It delivers 10--100$\times$ speedups over traditional solvers while maintaining a comparable accuracy and accurately identifies unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work demonstrates the potential of training a unified CFD solver exclusively from physics knowledge, offering a new approach for efficient and generalizable modeling across complex fluid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffeomorphic Neural Operator Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06690v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an operator learning approach for a class of evolution operators using a composition of a learned lift into the space of diffeomorphisms of the domain and the group action on the field space. In turn, this transforms the semigroup structure of the evolution operator into a corresponding group structure allowing time stepping be performed through composition on the space of diffeomorphisms rather than in the field space directly. This results in a number of structure-preserving properties related to preserving a relabelling symmetry of the dynamics as a hard constraint. We study the resolution properties of our approach, along with its connection to the techniques of diffeomorphic image registration. Numerical experiments on forecasting turbulent fluid dynamics are provided, demonstrating its conservative properties, non-diffusivity, and ability to capture anticipated statistical scaling relations at sub-grid scales. Our method provides an example of geometric operator learning and indicates a clear performance benefit from leveraging a priori known infinite-dimensional geometric structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance measurements of modern Fortran MPI applications with Score-P](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16592v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Version 3.0 of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard, released in 2012, introduced a new set of language bindings for Fortran 2008. By making use of modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was finally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran. This highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely adopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support for the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to recede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08 bindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by implementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard version 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By implementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for MPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The implementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08 wrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a spectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this work, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the implementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key component of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately 50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python pympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from the MPI standard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monolithic Multi-level Overlapping Schwarz Solvers for Fluid Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04356v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Additive overlapping Schwarz Methods are iterative methods of the domain decomposition type for the solution of partial differential equations. Numerical and parallel scalability of these methods can be achieved by adding coarse levels. A successful coarse space, inspired by iterative substructuring, is the generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) space. In https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1184047, based on the GDSW approach, two-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for saddle point problems were introduced. We present parallel results up to 32768 MPI ranks for the solution of incompressible fluid problems for a Poiseuille flow example on the unit cube and a complex extrusion die geometry using a two- and a three-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. These results are achieved through the combination of the additive overlapping Schwarz solvers implemented in the Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56750-7_19, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.64, and the FEATFLOW library http://www.featflow.de using a scalable interface for the efficient coupling of the two libraries. This work is part of the project StroemungsRaum - Novel Exascale-Architectures with Heterogeneous Hardware Components for Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations, funded by the German Bundesministerium fur Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt BMFTR (formerly BMBF) as part of the program on New Methods and Technologies for Exascale Computing (SCALEXA).</p></details> | <details><summary>GAMM9...</summary><p>GAMM95; fixed typo in metadata</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Linear Baseline Models for Scientific Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05831v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging, financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific machine learning problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 10 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven control of a magnetohydrodynamic flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12479v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; name changed, added references, polished language, expanded appendix</p></details> |
| **[Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Insect-Wing Structured Microfluidic System for Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10915v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for more efficient and adaptive computing grows, nature-inspired architectures offer promising alternatives to conventional electronic designs. Microfluidic platforms, drawing on biological forms and fluid dynamics, present a compelling foundation for low-power, high-resilience computing in environments where electronics are unsuitable. This study explores a hybrid reservoir computing system based on a dragonfly-wing inspired microfluidic chip, which encodes temporal input patterns as fluid interactions within the micro channel network. The system operates with three dye-based inlet channels and three camera-monitored detection areas, transforming discrete spatial patterns into dynamic color output signals. These reservoir output signals are then modified and passed to a simple and trainable readout layer for pattern classification. Using a combination of raw reservoir outputs and synthetically generated outputs, we evaluated system performance, system clarity, and data efficiency. The results demonstrate consistent classification accuracies up to $91\%$, even with coarse resolution and limited training data, highlighting the viability of the microfluidic reservoir computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Two-Phase Viscoelastic Fluid Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19974v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural, and biomedical systems. We consider a model that uses a continuum description of both phases in which separate momentum equations are used for each phase along with a co-incompressibility condition on the velocity fields. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and the co-incompressibility condition, and the resulting fluid dynamics motivate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to accurately capture regions of high stresses and large material gradients while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR discretization asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioning strategy introduced herein, the linear solver iterations are independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to ten fold speedup over a uniform grid in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-physics Model of Flow from Coronary Angiography: Insights to Microvascular Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04798v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) is characterized by impaired vasodilation and can lead to insufficient blood flow to the myocardium during stress or exertion, affecting millions of people globally. Despite their diagnostic value, invasive, wire-based diagnosis techniques of CMD, such as index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), are underutilized due to their complexity and inconsistency. Coronary angiography, one of the most commonly used imaging modalities, offers valuable flow information that assists in diagnosing CMD. However, this information is not fully understood or utilized in current clinical practice. In this study, a 3D-0D coupled multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and calibrated to simulate and study the process of contrast injection and washout during clinical angiography. A contrast intensity profile (CIP) was introduced to describe the dynamics of coronary angiography data. Additionally, sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of various coronary lumped parameter model (LPM) parameters on the shapes of CIPs. The results demonstrate that the multi-physics model can be effectively calibrated to produce physiologically meaningful hemodynamic results. Sensitivity studies reveal that resistance has a greater impact on the rising and falling slopes of CIP than capacitance, with higher resistance amplifying this effect. The model and results are presented here.

Studying AAA progression and rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years, geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution, as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic parameter estimation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

We propose workflow templates as a solution, offering adaptable designs for specific scientific applications. Our paper identifies common usage patterns for these templates, drawn from decades of HPC experience, including recent work with the MLCommons Science working group. We found that focusing on simple experiment management tools within the broader computational workflow improves adaptability, especially in education. This concept, which we term benchmark carpentry, is validated by two independent tools: Cloudmesh's Experiment Executor and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's SmartSim. Both frameworks, with significant functional overlap, have been tested across various scientific applications, including conduction cloudmask, earthquake prediction, simulation-AI/ML interactions, and the development of computational fluid dynamics surrogates.</p></details> |  |

Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability, and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin Reduced Order Models for fluid flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20739v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research paper investigates the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) method for reduced order models (ROM) and fluid dynamics governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Quasi Steady-State Frequency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21461v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean flow data assimilation using physics-constrained Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On zero-order consistency residue and background pressure for the conservative SPH fluid dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18210v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the major challenges for the conservative smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, the zero-order consistency issue, although thought to be mitigated by the particle regularization scheme, such as the transport velocity formulation, significantly damps the flow in a long channel for both laminar and turbulent simulations. Building on this finding, this paper not only thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel flow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical numerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient consistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background pressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To comprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its potential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the residue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid standing wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the pressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length, resolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient correction technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be effective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability is fundamentally limited. Finally, the FDA nozzle, an engineering benchmark, is tested to demonstrate the residue influence in a complex geometry, highlighting the necessity of correction schemes in scenarios with unavoidable high background pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages and 27 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Accelerated Aerodynamic Shape Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17786v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based, actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing' of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving the desired flow-field. By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense of a feature importance scoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A deterministic-particle-based scheme for micro-macro viscoelastic flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10970v8)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we introduce a new method for discretizing micro-macro models of dilute polymeric fluids by integrating a finite element discretization for the macroscopic fluid dynamic equation with a deterministic variational particle scheme for the microscopic Fokker-Planck equation. To address challenges arising from micro-macro coupling, we employ a discrete energetic variational approach to derive a coarse-grained micro-macro model with a particle approximation first and then develop a particle-FEM discretization for the coarse-grained model. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated for a Hookean dumbbell model in a Couette flow by comparing the computed velocity field with existing analytical solutions. We also use our method to study nonlinear FENE dumbbell models in different scenarios, such as extension flow, pure shear flow, and lid-driven cavity flow. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed deterministic particle approach can accurately capture the various key rheological phenomena in the original FENE model, including hysteresis and {\delta}-function-like spike behavior in extension flows, velocity overshoot phenomenon in pure shear flow, symmetries breaking, vortex center shifting and vortices weakening in the lid-driven cavity flow, with a small number of particles.</p></details> |  |

This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</p></details> |  |

The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANSdataset benchmark is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range of aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$) to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the training phase, but underperformed during testing. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, submitted to EWTEC</p></details> |

Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 1 figure |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models for fluid-porous systems: derivation, analysis and validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16577v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow interaction between a plain-fluid region in contact with a porous layer attracted significant attention from modelling and analysis sides due to numerous applications in biology, environment and industry. In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, Published in Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2025, DOI:/10.1016/j.amc.2025.129687</p></details> |

The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |

The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition, respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction, leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large and complex quantum systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for High-Dimensional Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09084v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is widely used for model reduction, its standard form does not take into account any parametric model structure. Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these either require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have limited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead assigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever the model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a posteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these weights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to compute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted POD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced basis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and snapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how these approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without the need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with and without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell thickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent partial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this problem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using weighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold interpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer high-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |

While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Tensor-based reduction of linear parameter-varying state-space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23591v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed to assess scalability.</p></details> |  |

The model class encompasses classical port-Hamiltonian systems, generalized gradient flows, and certain systems with algebraic constraints. Our framework combines existing ideas from the literature and systematically addresses temporal discretization, spatial discretization, and model order reduction, ensuring that all resulting schemes are dissipation-preserving in the sense of a discrete dissipation inequality. For this, we use a Petrov-Galerkin ansatz together with appropriate projections. Numerical results for a nonlinear circuit model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates for Nonintrusive Model Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nonlinear Causal Reductions to Explain Reinforcement Learning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14901v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expansive Natural Neural Gradient Flows for Energy Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13475v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops expansive gradient dynamics in deep neural network-induced mapping spaces. Specifically, we generate tools and concepts for minimizing a class of energy functionals in an abstract Hilbert space setting covering a wide scope of applications such as PDEs-based inverse problems and supervised learning. The approach hinges on a Hilbert space metric in the full diffeomorphism mapping space, which could be viewed as a generalized Wasserstein-2 metric. We then study a projection gradient descent method within deep neural network parameterized sets. More importantly, we develop an adaptation and expanding strategy to step-by-step enlarge the deep neural network structures. In particular, the expansion mechanism aims to enhance the alignment of the neural manifold induced natural gradient direction as well as possible with the ideal Hilbert space gradient descent direction leveraging the fact that we can evaluate projections of the Hilbert space gradient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for several simple model problems for energies arising in the context of supervised learning, model reduction, or inverse problems. In particular, we highlight the importance of assembling the neural flow matrix based on the inner product for the ambient Hilbert space. The actual algorithms are the simplest specifications of a broader spectrum based on a correspondingly wider discussion, postponing a detailed analysis to forthcoming work.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |
| **[Kernel-based Greedy Approximation of Parametric Elliptic Boundary Value Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06731v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We recently introduced a scale of kernel-based greedy schemes for approximating the solutions of elliptic boundary value problems. The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory. The resulting representation allows one to place error bounds on the $H_{\infty}$ norm on a reduced-order representation of the system computed using finite-dimensional nonlinear Controllability and Observability Gramians.</p></details> |  |
| **[An ensemble Kalman approach to randomized maximum likelihood estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03207v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes ensemble Kalman randomized maximum likelihood estimation, a new derivative-free method for performing randomized maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method that can be used to generate approximate samples from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems. The new method has connections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so that each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed optimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members converge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and, furthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior when applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method requires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data, be evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively expensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method tractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method tailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem. Theoretical results show near-optimality of this model reduction approach via convergence to an optimal approximation of the posterior covariance as a low-rank update to the prior covariance. Numerical experiments verify theoretical results and illustrate computational acceleration through model reduction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |
| **[Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |

This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum volume coordinates for Grassmann interpolation: Lagrange, Hermite, and errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01574v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to Riemannian interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. Instead of relying on the Riemannian normal coordinates, i.e. the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps, we approach the interpolation problem with an alternative set of local coordinates and corresponding parameterizations. A special property of these coordinates is that their calculation does not require any matrix decompositions. This is a numerical advantage over Riemann normal coordinates and many other retractions on the Grassmann manifold, especially when derivative data are to be treated. To estimate the interpolation error, we examine the conditioning of these mappings and state explicit bounds. It turns out that the parameterizations are well-conditioned, but the coordinate mappings are generally not. As a remedy, we introduce maximum-volume coordinates that are based on a search for subblocks of column-orthogonal matrices of large absolute determinant. We show that the order of magnitude of the asymptotic interpolation error on $\Gr(n,p)$ is the same as in the Euclidean space. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first is an academic one, where we interpolate a parametric orthogonal projector $QQ^T$, where the $Q$--factor stems from a parametric compact QR--decomposition. The second experiment is in the context of parametric model reduction of dynamical systems, where we interpolate reduced subspaces that are obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a model reduction approach for transport-dominated problems by employing cross-correlation based snapshot registration to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, thereby enabling the construction of efficient and accurate reduced-order models using linear approximation methods. We propose a complete framework comprising offline-online stages for the development of reduced order models using the cross-correlation based snapshots registration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using two test cases: 1D travelling waves and the higher-order methods benchmark test case, 2D isentropic convective vortex.</p></details> |  |

Our scheme is related to the recently-developed Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm that uses concepts from the Loewner framework. Our algorithm uses low-rank interpolation and iteratively adds interpolation points based on several criteria including minimizing maximum errors. We show there is freedom in the interpolation point selection method, leading to multiple algorithms that have trade-offs between computational complexity and approximation performance. We prove that a weighted \(H_2\) norm of a representative error system is monotonically decreasing as interpolation points are added. Finally, we provide computational results and some comparisons with prior works, demonstrating performance on par with standard model reduction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures Submitted to IEEE TAC</p></details> |

Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 4 figures, 2 tables; 25 pages supplementary material, 8 figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, cdc2025</p></details> |

The EGPT-PINN extends the traditional physics-informed neural networks and its recently proposed generative pre-trained strategy for linear model reduction to nonlinear model reduction and shock-capturing domains. By utilizing an adaptive meta-network, a simultaneously trained transform layer, entropy enhancement strategies, implementable shock interaction analysis, and a separable training process, the EGPT-PINN efficiently captures complex parameter-dependent shock formations and interactions. Numerical results of EGPT-PINN applied to the families of inviscid Burgers' equation and the Euler equations, parameterized by their initial conditions, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed technique. It accurately solves the viscosity solution via very few neurons without leveraging any {\it a priori} knowledge of the equations or its initial condition. Moreover, via a simple augmentation of the loss function by model-data mismatch, we demonstrate the robustness of EGPT-PINN in solving inverse problems more accurately than the vanilla and entropy-enhanced versions of PINN.</p></details> | 24 pages,12 figures |
| **[Automatic and Structure-Aware Sparsification of Hybrid Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18996v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) integrate mechanistic models with neural ODEs, offering strong inductive bias and flexibility, and are particularly advantageous in data-scarce healthcare settings. However, excessive latent states and interactions from mechanistic models can lead to training inefficiency and over-fitting, limiting practical effectiveness of hybrid neural ODEs. In response, we propose a new hybrid pipeline for automatic state selection and structure optimization in mechanistic neural ODEs, combining domain-informed graph modifications with data-driven regularization to sparsify the model for improving predictive performance and stability while retaining mechanistic plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show improved predictive performance and robustness with desired sparsity, establishing an effective solution for hybrid model reduction in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

This model has been shown to be unstable when the radial gradient is too steep. In this work, we present a new derivation of the Fick-Jacobs equation that results in the addition of higher order spatial derivative terms that provide additional stability in a wide variety of cases and improved solution convergence. We also derive new numerical schemes for branched nodes within networks and provide stability conditions for these schemes. The computational accuracy, efficiency, and stability of our method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical examples.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Neural empirical interpolation method for nonlinear model reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03562v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the neural empirical interpolation method (NEIM), a neural network-based alternative to the discrete empirical interpolation method for reducing the time complexity of computing the nonlinear term in a reduced order model (ROM) for a parameterized nonlinear partial differential equation. NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some "optimal" coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.

| **[Application of a Novel Model Reduction Technique to the Assessment of Boundedness/Stability of Some Delay Time-Varying Vector Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11398v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains a challenging problem with broad applications in science and engineering. Existing methods tend to produce overly conservative criteria that offer limited practical value and often fail to explicitly characterize the temporal evolution of solution norms. This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the evolution of solution norms in such systems. This approach constructs scalar counterparts for the original vector equations. We prove that the solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also include delays and variable coefficients, provide upper bounds for the norms of the original solutions, if the history functions for both equations are properly matched. This reduction enables the evaluation of the boundedness and stability of vector systems through the analysis of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, which can be performed via straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. Consequently, we introduce new criteria for boundedness and stability and estimate the radii of the balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems. Finally, we validated our inferences through representative simulations that also assessed the accuracy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 18 pages |

An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper.

| **[Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate its excellent performance and attractive features for practical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their relevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is leveraged to delineate both known and new design methodologies for control and observation of cascades, and to characterize structural properties of reduced models. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic categorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for observation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear time-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for nonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly comprehensive nonlinear theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, revised version</p></details> |
| **[Generative Learning for Slow Manifolds and Bifurcation Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20375v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit. In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aerial Image Classification in Scarce and Unconstrained Environments via Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17655v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Benefits of Memory for Modeling Time-Dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02313v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.</p></details> |  |

While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUPRA: Subspace Parameterized Attention for Neural Operator on General Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15897v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators are efficient surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their key components face challenges: (1) in order to improve accuracy, attention mechanisms suffer from computational inefficiency on large-scale meshes, and (2) spectral convolutions rely on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on regular grids and assume a flat geometry, which causes accuracy degradation on irregular domains. To tackle these problems, we regard the matrix-vector operations in the standard attention mechanism on vectors in Euclidean space as bilinear forms and linear operators in vector spaces and generalize the attention mechanism to function spaces. This new attention mechanism is fully equivalent to the standard attention but impossible to compute due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces. To address this, inspired by model reduction techniques, we propose a Subspace Parameterized Attention (SUPRA) neural operator, which approximates the attention mechanism within a finite-dimensional subspace. To construct a subspace on irregular domains for SUPRA, we propose using the Laplacian eigenfunctions, which naturally adapt to domains' geometry and guarantee the optimal approximation for smooth functions. Experiments show that the SUPRA neural operator reduces error rates by up to 33% on various PDE datasets while maintaining state-of-the-art computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and inference in error-in-operator model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11834v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many statistical problems can be reduced to a linear inverse problem in which only a noisy version of the operator is available. Particular examples include random design regression, deconvolution problem, instrumental variable regression, functional data analysis, error-in-variable regression, drift estimation in stochastic diffusion, and many others. The pragmatic plug-in approach can be well justified in the classical asymptotic setup with a growing sample size. However, recent developments in high dimensional inference reveal some new features of this problem. In high dimensional linear regression with a random design, the plug-in approach is questionable but the use of a simple ridge penalization yields a benign overfitting phenomenon; see \cite{baLoLu2020}, \cite{ChMo2022}, \cite{NoPuSp2024}. This paper revisits the general Error-in-Operator problem for finite samples and high dimension of the source and image spaces. A particular focus is on the choice of a proper regularization. We show that a simple ridge penalty (Tikhonov regularization) works properly in the case when the operator is more regular than the signal. In the opposite case, some model reduction technique like spectral truncation should be applied.</p></details> |  |

A prominent contemporary example is from aerospace propulsion, where HPC is used for rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) simulations in support of the design of next-generation rocket engines; however, these simulations take millions of core hours even on powerful supercomputers, which makes them impractical for engineering tasks like design exploration and risk assessment. Data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) aim to address this limitation by constructing computationally cheap yet sufficiently accurate approximations that serve as surrogates for the high-fidelity model. This paper contributes a distributed memory algorithm that achieves fast and scalable construction of predictive physics-based ROMs trained from sparse datasets of extremely large state dimension. The algorithm learns structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets.This enables model reduction for problems at a scale and complexity that exceeds the capabilities of standard, serial approaches. We demonstrate our algorithm's scalability using up to $2,048$ cores on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We focus on a real-world three-dimensional RDRE for which one millisecond of simulated physical time requires one million core hours on a supercomputer. Using a training dataset of $2,536$ snapshots each of state dimension $76$ million, our distributed algorithm enables the construction of a predictive data-driven reduced model in just $13$ seconds on $2,048$ cores on Frontera.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, a mathematical expression for the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is derived, which quantifies the error within the desired frequency interval. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the error are derived. The inherent difficulty in satisfying these conditions within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. Using the optimality conditions and the Petrov-Galerkin projection, a stationary point iteration algorithm is proposed, which approximately satisfies these optimality conditions upon convergence. The main computational effort in the proposed algorithm involves solving sparse-dense Sylvester equations. These equations are frequently encountered in $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction algorithms and can be solved efficiently. Moreover, the algorithm bypasses the requirement of matrix logarithm computation, which is typically necessary for most frequency-limited reduction methods and can be computationally demanding for high-order systems. An illustrative example is provided to numerically validate the developed theory. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness in accurately approximating the original high-order model within the specified frequency range is demonstrated through the reduction of an advection-diffusion equation-based model, commonly used in model reduction literature for testing algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm's computational efficiency is highlighted by successfully reducing a flexible space structure model of order one million.</p></details> |  |

For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates.

| **[Balanced Truncation via Tangential Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13358v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the construction of rth-order truncated balanced realizations via tangential interpolation at r specified interpolation points. It is demonstrated that when the truncated Hankel singular values are negligible-that is, when the discarded states are nearly uncontrollable and unobservable-balanced truncation simplifies to a bi-tangential Hermite interpolation problem at r interpolation points. In such cases, the resulting truncated balanced realization is nearly H2-optimal and thus interpolates the original model at the mirror images of its poles along its residual directions. Like standard H2-optimal model reduction, where the interpolation points and tangential directions that yield a local optimum are not known, in balanced truncation as well, the interpolation points and tangential directions required to produce a truncated balanced realization remain unknown. To address this, we propose an iterative tangential interpolation-based algorithm for balanced truncation. Upon convergence, the algorithm yields a low-rank truncated balanced realization that accurately preserves the r largest Hankel singular values of the original system. An adaptive scheme to automatically select the order r of the reduced model is also proposed. The algorithm is fully automatic, choosing both the interpolation data and the model order without user intervention. Additionally, an adaptive low-rank solver for Lyapunov equations based on tangential interpolation is proposed, automatically selecting both the interpolation data and the rank without user intervention. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on benchmark models, confirming their efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Intrusive model order reduction techniques exhibit high accuracy levels, however, they are rarely used as a standalone industrial tool, because of the required high level knowledge involved in the construction and usage of these techniques. Moreover, the computation time benefit is compromised for highly nonlinear problems. On the other hand, non-intrusive methods often struggle with accuracy in nonlinear cases, typically requiring a large design of experiment and a large number of snapshots achieve a reliable performance. However, generating the stiffness matrix in a non-intrusive approach presents an optimal way to align accuracy with efficiency, allying the advantages of both intrusive and non-intrusive methods.This work introduces a lightly intrusive model order reduction technique that employs machine learning within a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition framework to achieve this alliance. By leveraging outputs from commercial full-order models, this method constructs a reduced-order model that operates effectively without requiring expert user intervention. The proposed technique has the possibility to approximate linear non affine as well as non linear terms. It is showcased for linear and nonlinear structural mechanics problems.</p></details> |  |

However, standard inference for these models has the typical cubic scaling, and common scalable approximation schemes for GPs cannot be applied since the covariance function is non-continuous. In this work, we derive a basis function approximation scheme for mixed-domain covariance functions, which scales linearly with respect to the number of observations and total number of basis functions. The proposed approach is naturally applicable to also Bayesian GP regression with discrete observation models. We demonstrate the scalability of the approach and compare model reduction techniques for additive GP models in a longitudinal data context. We confirm that we can approximate the exact GP model accurately in a fraction of the runtime compared to fitting the corresponding exact model. In addition, we demonstrate a scalable model reduction workflow for obtaining smaller and more interpretable models when dealing with a large number of candidate predictors.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Differential Controllability and Observability Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03250v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential balancing theory for nonlinear model reduction relies on differential controllability and observability functions. In this paper, we further investigate them from two different perspectives. First, we establish novel connections between these differential energy functions and their incremental counterparts by assuming the existence of the corresponding optimal state feedback for each controllability function. Specifically, an upper bound on the incremental controllability/observability function is provided by the corresponding differential energy function. Conversely, an upper bound on the differential controllability function can be estimated from the incremental controllability function. Furthermore, the differential observability function can be constructed from the incremental observability function. Second, we explore the positive definiteness of the differential controllability/observability function in the context of controllability/observability and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validation and Calibration of Energy Models with Real Vehicle Data from Chassis Dynamometer Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21057v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of vehicle fuel consumption typically requires detailed modeling of complex internal powertrain dynamics, often resulting in computationally intensive simulations. However, many transportation applications-such as traffic flow modeling, optimization, and control-require simplified models that are fast, interpretable, and easy to implement, while still maintaining fidelity to physical energy behavior. This work builds upon a recently developed model reduction pipeline that derives physics-like energy models from high-fidelity Autonomie vehicle simulations. These reduced models preserve essential vehicle dynamics, enabling realistic fuel consumption estimation with minimal computational overhead. While the reduced models have demonstrated strong agreement with their Autonomie counterparts, previous validation efforts have been confined to simulation environments. This study extends the validation by comparing the reduced energy model's outputs against real-world vehicle data. Focusing on the MidSUV category, we tune the baseline Autonomie model to closely replicate the characteristics of a Toyota RAV4. We then assess the accuracy of the resulting reduced model in estimating fuel consumption under actual drive conditions. Our findings suggest that, when the reference Autonomie model is properly calibrated, the simplified model produced by the reduction pipeline can provide reliable, semi-principled fuel rate estimates suitable for large-scale transportation applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model reduction of convection-dominated viscous conservation laws using implicit feature tracking and landmark image registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17463v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) remain generally unreliable for convection-dominated problems, such as those encountered in hypersonic flows, due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of linear subspace approximations, known as the Kolmogorov barrier. This limitation hinders the accuracy of traditional ROMs and necessitates impractical amounts of training data during the offline phase. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel landmark-based registration procedure tailored for ROMs of convection-dominated problems. Our approach leverages limited training data and incorporates a nonlinear transformation of the data using a landmark-based registration technique combined with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. During the offline phase, we align dominant convective features in a reference domain, resulting in a rapid decay of error relative to the reduced space dimension. Landmarks are generated through a three-step process: (1) detecting shocks via edge detection techniques, (2) sampling using Monte Carlo methods, and (3) domain partitioning with $k$-means clustering, where cluster centroids serve as landmarks. Accurate landmark correspondence is achieved by minimizing pairing distances for similar features. The online phase integrates standard minimum-residual ROM methodologies, extending the optimization space to include admissible domain mappings. We validate our approach on two test cases: a space-time Burgers' equation parameterized by the initial condition, and a hypersonic viscous flow over a cylinder parameterized by the Mach number. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in overcoming the Kolmogorov barrier and enhancing the reliability of ROMs for convection-dominated problems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version (note that title changed from previous version)</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian learning with Gaussian processes for low-dimensional representations of time-dependent nonlinear systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03455v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a data-driven method for learning low-dimensional time-dependent physics-based surrogate models whose predictions are endowed with uncertainty estimates. We use the operator inference approach to model reduction that poses the problem of learning low-dimensional model terms as a regression of state space data and corresponding time derivatives by minimizing the residual of reduced system equations. Standard operator inference models perform well with accurate training data that are dense in time, but producing stable and accurate models when the state data are noisy and/or sparse in time remains a challenge. Another challenge is the lack of uncertainty estimation for the predictions from the operator inference models. Our approach addresses these challenges by incorporating Gaussian process surrogates into the operator inference framework to (1) probabilistically describe uncertainties in the state predictions and (2) procure analytical time derivative estimates with quantified uncertainties. The formulation leads to a generalized least-squares regression and, ultimately, reduced-order models that are described probabilistically with a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution of the operators. The resulting probabilistic surrogate model propagates uncertainties from the observed state data to reduced-order predictions. We demonstrate the method is effective for constructing low-dimensional models of two nonlinear partial differential equations representing a compressible flow and a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, as well as for estimating the parameters of a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing compartmental models in epidemiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Sandialabs/GP-BayesOpInf</p></details> |

| **[Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |

Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally, moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizations of data-driven balancing: What to sample for different balancing-based reduced models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12561v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadrature-based balanced truncation (QuadBT) framework of arXiv:2104.01006 is a non-intrusive reformulation of balanced truncation (BT), a classical projection-based model-order reduction technique for linear systems. QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

A core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii) specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple, task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required to design DTs. In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models. It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.</p></details> |  |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |

The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced-order modeling of Hamiltonian dynamics based on symplectic neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11911v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM) framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11542v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.</p></details> |  |

The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Collocation Point Strategies For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700v4)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose two adaptive collocation point selection strategies utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approaches improve PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</p></details> |  |

The approach begins with the introduction of innovative monolithic and global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithms, which incorporate the backward differentiation formulas for time discretization. In each iteration, these algorithms involve solving a diffusion subproblem over the entire temporal domain, followed by solving a generalized Stokes subproblem over the same time interval. To accelerate the global-in-time iterative process, we present a reduced order modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition, aimed at reducing the primary computational cost from the generalized Stokes subproblem. The effectiveness of this novel method is validated both theoretically and through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Using push-forward maps and Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow, we reformulate the TDSE as a Hamiltonian system in terms of push-forward maps. The new formulation can be viewed as a generative model in the Wasserstein space, which is a manifold of probability density functions. Then we parameterize the push-forward maps by reduce-order models such as neural networks. This induces a new metric in the parameter space by pulling back the Wasserstein metric on density manifold, which further results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters of the reduce-order model. Leveraging the computational techniques from deep learning, such as Neural ODE, we design an algorithm to solve the TDSE in the parameterized push-forward map space, which provides an alternative approach with the potential to scale up to high-dimensional problems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Order Data-driven Twin Models for Nonlinear PDEs by Randomized Koopman Orthogonal Decomposition and Explainable Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03325v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a data-driven twin modeling framework based on modern Koopman operator theory, offering a significant advancement over classical modal decomposition by accurately capturing nonlinear dynamics with reduced complexity and no manual parameter adjustment. The method integrates a novel algorithm with Pareto front analysis to construct a compact, high-fidelity reduced-order model that balances accuracy and efficiency. An explainable NLARX deep learning framework enables real-time, adaptive calibration and prediction, while a key innovation-computing orthogonal Koopman modes via randomized orthogonal projections-ensures optimal data representation. This approach for data-driven twin modeling is fully self-consistent, avoiding heuristic choices and enhancing interpretability through integrated explainable learning techniques. The proposed method is demonstrated on shock wave phenomena using three experiments of increasing complexity, accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the resulting data-driven twin models.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |

The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetry-reduced model reduction of shift-equivariant systems via operator inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18780v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven reduced-order models of partial differential equations with shift equivariance. Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Continuous- and Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18131v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse scattering for Schrödinger equation in the frequency domain via data-driven reduced order modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11034v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we develop a numerical method for solving an inverse scattering problem of estimating the scattering potential in a Schr\"{o}dinger equation from frequency domain measurements based on reduced order models (ROM). The ROM is a projection of Schr\"{o}dinger operator onto a subspace spanned by its solution snapshots at certain wavenumbers. Provided the measurements are performed at these wavenumbers, the ROM can be constructed in a data-driven manner from the measurements on a surface surrounding the scatterers. Once the ROM is computed, the scattering potential can be estimated using non-linear optimization that minimizes the ROM misfit. Such an approach typically outperforms the conventional methods based on data misfit minimization. We develop two variants of ROM-based algorithms for inverse scattering and test them on a synthetic example in two spatial dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers based on an ALE approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13613v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a Galerkin projection-based reduced-order modelling (ROM) approach for segregated fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, formulated within an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework at low Reynolds numbers using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is constructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and incorporates a data-driven technique that combines classical Galerkin projection with radial basis function (RBF) networks. The results demonstrate the numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed method relative to the high-fidelity model. The ROM successfully captures transient flow fields and, importantly, the forces acting on the moving structure without exhibiting unphysical growth or divergence over time. This is further supported by the bounded evolution of error metrics and physical observables, which remain consistent with the full-order simulations throughout the prediction horizon. The method's effectiveness is validated through a benchmark vortex-induced vibration (VIV) case involving a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=200. The hybrid ROM approach yields an accurate and efficient tool for solving FSI problems involving mesh motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow singular value decay. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method, but with a data-driven basis. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying the space-local POD, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions compared to standard POD, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method. Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D and 2D advection equation. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, source code can be found at https://github.com/tobyvg/local_POD_overlap.jl</p></details> |
| **[Blending data and physics for reduced-order modeling of systems with spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21299v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.</p></details> |  |

The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |

For stable reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems. The implementation is made available for reproducibility and further use.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

For both the continuous and the discrete (finite element) settings, we prove that the new strategy yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers that were not covered by current results. We also show that the new feedback control yields more accurate results than the current control approaches in marginally-resolved numerical simulations of a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=1000$. We note, however, that for realistic control parameters, the stabilizing effect of the new feedback control strategy is not sufficient in the convection-dominated regime. Our second contribution is the development of an adaptive evolve-filter-relax (aEFR) regularization that stabilizes marginally-resolved simulations in the convection-dominated regime and increases the accuracy of the new feedback control in realistic parameter settings. For the finite element setting, we prove that the novel feedback control equipped with the new aEFR method yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, our numerical investigation shows that the new strategy yields accurate results for reduced order models that dramatically decrease the size of the feedback control problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors. The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively. Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder QR. For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for highly ill-conditioned matrices. The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments on a laptop and computation server.</p></details> | Preprint |

The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

The evaluation of objective and constraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used to explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models are sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control problem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions requires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE). The models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the Boussinesq PDE.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 17 figures, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Large-Scale Linear Parameter Varying Systems with Dynamic Mode Decomposition Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02336v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems are a well-established class of nonlinear systems with a rich theory for stability analysis, control, and analytical response finding, among other aspects. Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 9 figures.

| **[An Adaptive Port Technique for Synthesising Rotational Components in Component Modal Synthesis Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03276v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Component Modal Synthesis (CMS) is a reduced order modelling method widely used for large-scale complex systems. It can effectively approximate system-level models through component synthesis, in which the repetitive geometrical components are modelled once and synthesised together. However, the conventional CMS only applies to systems with stationary components connected by strictly compatible ports, limiting it from modelling systems with moving components. This paper presents an adaptive port (AP) technique to extend CMS approaches for modelling parametric systems with rotational parts. To demonstrate the capability of the AP technique, we apply it to the Static Condensation Reduced Basis Element (SCRBE), one widely used variant of CMS approaches. The AP-based SCRBE (AP-SCRBE) can enforce the synthesis of rotational-stationary components over a shared adaptive port when the connecting surfaces of two components are discretisation-wise incompatible, which happens when one component moves relative to the others. Numerical experiments on the NREL 5MW wind turbine show that, in the context of rotational-stationary component synthesis, the AP-SCRBE can accurately and efficiently model the rotating rotor with pitch rotation of blades. It can produce almost identical results to a high-fidelity finite element model at two to three orders faster speeds.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.</p></details> | <details><summary>artic...</summary><p>article, 49 pages, 29 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[High order global flux schemes for general steady state preservation of shallow water moment equations with non-conservative products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00573v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow water moment equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that allow to represent vertical variations of the velocity profile at the expense of additional evolution equations for a number of additional variables, so called moments. This introduces non-linear non-conservative products in the system, which make the analytical characterization of steady states much harder if not impossible. The lack of analytical steady states poses a challenge for the design of well-balanced schemes, which aim at preserving such steady states as crucial in many applications. In this work, we present a family of fully well-balanced, high-order WENO finite volume methods for general hyperbolic balance laws with non-conservative products like the shallow water moment equations, for which no analytical steady states are available. The schemes are based on the flux globalization approach, in which both source terms and non-conservative products are integrated with a tailored high order quadrature in the divergence term. The resulting global flux is then reconstructed instead of the conservative variables to preserve all steady states. Numerical tests show the optimal convergence of the method and a significant error reduction for steady state solutions. Furthermore, we provide a numerical comparison of perturbed steady states for different families of shallow water moment equations, which illustrates the flexibility of our method that is valid for general equations without prior knowledge of steady states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Physics-Based Li-ion Battery Model via Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Learning and Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00353v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |

The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems. Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate normal-forms for the numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of navier-stokes flows via machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21275v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate how the embed-learn-lift framework enables the construction of surrogate normal-forms, namely minimal-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs), from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations. These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Exact operator inference with minimal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01244v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel method to generate snapshot data for operator inference that guarantees the exact reconstruction of intrusive projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs). To ensure exact reconstruction, the operator inference least squares matrix must have full rank, without regularization. Existing works have achieved this full rank using heuristic strategies to generate snapshot data and a-posteriori checks on full rank, but without a guarantee of success. Our novel snapshot data generation method provides this guarantee thanks to two key ingredients: first we identify ROM states that induce full rank, then we generate snapshots corresponding to exactly these states by simulating multiple trajectories for only a single time step. This way, the number of required snapshots is minimal and orders of magnitude lower than typically reported with existing methods. The method avoids non-Markovian terms and does not require re-projection. Since the number of snapshots is minimal, the least squares problem simplifies to a linear system that is numerically more stable. In addition, because the inferred operators are exact, properties of the intrusive ROM operators such as symmetry or skew-symmetry are preserved. Numerical results for differential equations involving 2nd, 3rd and 8th order polynomials demonstrate that the novel snapshot data generation method leads to exact reconstruction of the intrusive reduced order models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

Both ALEs are non-canonical conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems with the Poisson matrix depending quadratically on the state variables, and with quadratic Hamiltonian. The full-order solutions are obtained with the energy preserving midpoint rule for the conservative ALE and exponential midpoint rule for the dissipative ALE. The reduced-order solutions are constructed intrusively by preserving the skew-symmetric structure of the reduced non-canonical Hamiltonian system by applying proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the Galerkin projection. For an efficient offline-online decomposition of the ROMs, the quadratic nonlinear terms of the Poisson matrix are approximated by the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The computation of the reduced-order solutions is further accelerated by the use of tensor techniques. Preservation of the Hamiltonian and momentum for the conservative ALE, and preservation of dissipation properties of the dissipative ALE, guarantee the long-term stability of soliton solutions.</p></details> |  |

While traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system, enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion. This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3) full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control. These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at Advances in Robotics (AIR) Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Particle in Cell method for the Vlasov-Poisson system using auto-encoder and Hamiltonian neural](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15203v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian particle-based simulations of plasma dynamics are inherently computationally intensive, primarily due to the large number of particles required to obtain accurate solutions. This challenge becomes even more acute in many-query contexts, where numerous simulations must be conducted across a range of time and parameter values. Consequently, it is essential to construct reduced order models from such discretizations to significantly lower computational costs while ensuring validity across the specified time and parameter domains. Preserving the Hamiltonian structure in these reduced models is also crucial, as it helps maintain long-term stability. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear, non-intrusive, data-driven model order reduction method for the 1D-1V Vlasov--Poisson system, discretized using a Hamiltonian Particle-In-Cell scheme. Our approach relies on a two-step projection framework: an initial linear projection based on the Proper Symplectic Decomposition, followed by a nonlinear projection learned via an autoencoder neural network. The reduced dynamics are then modeled using a Hamiltonian neural network. The offline phase of the method is split into two stages: first, constructing the linear projection using full-order model snapshots; second, jointly training the autoencoder and the Hamiltonian neural network to simultaneously learn the encoder-decoder mappings and the reduced dynamics. We validate the proposed method on several benchmarks, including Landau damping and two-stream instability. The results show that our method has better reduction properties than standard linear Hamiltonian reduction methods.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the time integration of the fully discrete reduced order model. Most of the analysis in the literature has been carried out for the implicit Euler method as time integrator. We integrate in time the reduced order model with the BDF-q time stepping ($1\le q\le 5$) and prove optimal rate of convergence of order $q$ in time. Our set of snapshots is obtained from finite element approximations to the original model problem computed at different times. These finite element approximations can be obtained with any time integrator. The POD method is based on first order difference quotients of the snapshots. The reason for doing this is twofold. On the one hand, the use of difference quotients allow us to provide pointwise-in-time error bounds. On the other, the use of difference quotients is essential to get the expected rate $q$ in time since we apply that the BDF-q time stepping, $1\le q\le 5$, can be written as a linear combination of first order difference quotients.</p></details> |  |

The approach combines optimized sensor placement with a physics-informed guided generative model. Sensor locations are selected using mutual information theory applied to a reduced-order model of the flow, enabling efficient identification of high-information observation points with minimal computational cost. These sensors, once selected, provide targeted observations that guide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model conditioned by physical constraints. Extensive experiments on 2D laminar cylinder wake flows demonstrate that under sparse sensing conditions, the structured sensor layouts fail to capture key flow dynamics, yielding high reconstruction errors. In contrast, our optimized sensor placement strategy achieves accurate reconstructions with L2 errors as low as 0.05, even with a limited number of sensors, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-limited regimes. When the number of sensors is higher than a threshold, however, both methods perform comparably. Our dual-guided approach bridges reduced order model-based sensor position optimization with modern generative modeling, providing accurate, physics-consistent reconstruction from sparse data for scientific machine-learning problems.</p></details> |  |

Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages (31 pages of main text and Appendix, 5 of Supplement), 8 Figures (6 in the main text and Appendix and 2 in the Supplement)</p></details> |

We show that continuous-discrete hybrid systems are compatible with logical models of knowledge already used in distributed computing, and demonstrate its usefulness by deriving sufficient epistemic conditions for exploration and gathering robot tasks to be solvable. We provide a separation of the physical and computational aspects of a robotic system, allowing us to decouple the problems related to each and directly use methods from control theory and distributed computing, fields that are traditionally distant in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate a novel approach for reasoning about the knowledge in multi-robot systems through a principled method of converting a switched hybrid dynamical system into a temporal-epistemic logic model, passing through an abstract state machine representation. This creates space for methods and results to be exchanged across the fields of control theory, distributed computing and temporal-epistemic logic, while reasoning about multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba State-Space Models Are Lyapunov-Stable Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00209v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba state-space models (SSMs) have recently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) in various tasks and been widely adapted. However, a major concern for stable learning in recurrent-based deep models (such as SSMs) is the sensitivity of their recurrent dynamics. Despite widespread adaptation, the sensitivity of Mamba's recurrent dynamics under common fine-tuning methods-e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-remains unexplored. Empirically, we show that Mamba LLMs are extremely stable to changes introduced by combinations of MPFT and PEFT, in stark contrast to Transformer LLMs, which we demonstrate may drastically diverge from their respective full-precision counterparts under different combinations of MPFT and PEFT (despite the near-ubiquitous adaptation of these fine-tuning frameworks for attention-based models). The demonstrated robustness of Mamba LLMs are due to their recurrent dynamics, which we prove are guaranteed to be stable using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov stability). We conclude by using MPFT and PEFT to novelly study Mamba LLMs' in-context learning (ICL) abilities on natural language tasks, thus supplementing other recent work.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR,...</summary><p>TMLR, 27 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21220v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs. DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate.

| **[Bridging Finite and Infinite-Horizon Nash Equilibria in Linear Quadratic Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20675v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium, while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise, correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-informed machine learning for the prediction of chaotic dynamical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19861v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning (QIML) framework for the long-term dynamical behavior of high-dimensional chaotic systems. The method combines a one-time, offline-trained quantum generative model with a classical autoregressive predictor for spatiotemporal field generation. The quantum model learns a quantum prior (Q-Prior) that guides the representation of small-scale interactions and improves the modeling of fine-scale dynamics. We evaluate QIML on three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and a cross-section of fully developed three-dimensional turbulent channel flow used as a realistic inflow condition. Compared to the classical baseline, QIML yields up to 17.25% improvement in predictive distribution accuracy and a 29.36% improvement in the fidelity of the predicted full energy spectrum. For turbulent channel inflow, the Q-Prior is essential: without it, the model fails to evolve in time, while QIML produces stable, physically consistent forecasts that surpass leading machine learning models for PDEs, including the Fourier Neural Operator and Markov Neural Operator, whose errors diverge. Beyond accuracy, QIML also achieves a memory advantage, compressing multi-megabyte datasets into a kilobyte-scale Q-Prior that captures only the invariant measure needed to guide the classical model, thus circumventing Holevo's bound by avoiding full data reconstruction. Our findings provide a practical and scalable pathway for integrating the advantages brought by quantum devices into large-scale scientific, engineering modeling and simulation.</p></details> | 41 pages, 15 figures |

To address the analytically intractable nature of the predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay. We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times compared to traditional numerical methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 Figure |

To ensure reactivity and robustness to disturbances, we propose a novel approach that selects a target point at each time step for the robot to follow, by combining tools from control theory and the target trajectory generated by the learned NODE. A correction term to the NODE model is computed online by solving a quadratic program that guarantees stability and safety using control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions, respectively. Our approach outperforms baseline DS learning techniques on the LASA handwriting dataset and complex periodic trajectories. It is also validated on the Franka Emika robot arm to produce stable motions for wiping and stirring tasks that do not have a single attractor, while being robust to perturbations and safe around humans and obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression have automated this process. As several methods are available in the literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Set-based State Estimation for Safety-Critical Applications under Adversarial Attacks on Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05075v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Set-based state estimation provides guaranteed state inclusion certificates that are crucial for the safety verification of dynamical systems. However, when system sensors are subject to cyberattacks, maintaining both safety and security guarantees becomes a fundamental challenge that existing point-based secure state estimation methods cannot adequately address due to their inherent inability to provide state inclusion certificates. This paper introduces a novel approach that simultaneously ensures safety guarantees through guaranteed state inclusion and security guarantees against sensor attacks, without imposing conservative restrictions on system operation. We propose a Secure Set-based State Estimation (S3E) algorithm that maintains the true system state within the estimated set under sensor attacks, provided the initialization set contains the initial state and the system remains observable from the uncompromised sensor subset. The algorithm gives the estimated set as a collection of constrained zonotopes (agreement sets), which can be employed as robust certificates for verifying whether the system adheres to safety constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimated set remains unaffected by attack signals of sufficiently large magnitude and also establish sufficient conditions for attack detection, identification, and filtering. This compels the attacker to only inject signals of small magnitudes to evade detection, thus preserving the accuracy of the estimated set. To address the computational complexity of the algorithm, we offer several strategies for complexity-performance trade-offs. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through several examples, including its application to a three-story building model.</p></details> |  |

Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical point of view.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding, pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning.

| **[Deception in Oligopoly Games via Adaptive Nash Seeking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24112v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the theory of multi-agent systems, deception refers to the strategic manipulation of information to influence the behavior of other agents, ultimately altering the long-term dynamics of the entire system. Recently, this concept has been examined in the context of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) algorithms for noncooperative games. Specifically, it was demonstrated that players can exploit knowledge of other players' exploration signals to drive the system toward a ``deceptive" Nash equilibrium, while maintaining the stability of the closed-loop system. To extend this insight beyond the duopoly case, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive study of deception mechanisms in N-player oligopoly markets. By leveraging the structure of these games and employing stability techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems, we provide game-theoretic insights into deception and derive specialized results, including stability conditions. These results allow players to systematically adjust their NES dynamics by tuning gains and signal amplitudes, all while ensuring closed-loop stability. Additionally, we introduce novel sufficient conditions to demonstrate that the (practically) stable equilibrium point of the deceptive dynamics corresponds to a true Nash equilibrium of a different game, which we term the ``deceptive game." Our results show that, under the proposed adaptive dynamics with deception, a victim firm may develop a distorted perception of its competitors' product appeal, which could lead to setting suboptimal prices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Real-Time Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Games with Quadratic Payoffs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12337v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent autonomous systems, deception is a fundamental concept which characterizes the exploitation of unbalanced information to mislead victims into choosing oblivious actions. This effectively alters the system's long term behavior, leading to outcomes that may be beneficial to the deceiver but detrimental to victim. We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) where players implement independent stochastic exploration signals to learn the pseudogradient flow. In particular, we show that deceptive players who obtain real-time measurements of other players' stochastic perturbation can incorporate this information into their own NES action update, consequentially steering the overall dynamics to a new operating point that could potentially improve the payoffs of the deceptive players. We consider games with quadratic payoff functions, as this restriction allows us to derive a more explicit formulation of the capabilities of the deceptive players. By leveraging results on multi-input stochastic averaging for dynamical systems, we establish local exponential (in probability) convergence for the proposed deceptive NES dynamics. To illustrate our results, we apply them to a two player quadratic game.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of Data Reduction Criteria for Online Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10815v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty. However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior. The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets, including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP algorithm.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity-based Control of Power Converters: Simulation and Experimental Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18719v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Here we propose a general method to convert a Quadratic Program (QP) into a Second-Order Cone Problem (SOCP), which is shown to be Lipschitz continuous. Key features of our approach are that (i) the regularity of the resulting formulation does not depend on the structural properties of the constraints, such as the linear independence of their gradients; and (ii) it admits a closed-form solution, which is not available for general QPs with multiple constraints, enabling faster computation.

This paper develops methods to formulate and solve optimization problems for dynamic systems in real time using constrained zonotope reachability analysis. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented that makes efficient use of the constrained zonotope structure. To increase the efficiency of the ADMM iterations, reachability calculations are presented that increase the sparsity of the matrices used to define a constrained zonotope when compared to typical methods. The developed methods are used to formulate and solve predictive control, state estimation, and safety verification problems. Numerical results show that optimization times using the proposed approach are competitive with state-of-the-art QP solvers and conventional problem formulations. A combined set-valued state estimation and moving horizon estimation algorithm is presented and experimentally demonstrated in the context of robot localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably-Safe Neural Network Training Using Hybrid Zonotope Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13023v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical control applications, it remains difficult to enforce constraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in such settings. While many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's satisfaction of safety constraints, few address how to correct an unsafe network. The handful of works that extract a training signal from verification cannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To begin addressing these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training method that can encourage the exact image of a non-convex input set for a neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a non-convex unsafe region. This is accomplished by reachability analysis with scaled hybrid zonotopes, a modification of the existing hybrid zonotope set representation that enables parameterized scaling of non-convex polytopic sets with a differentiable collision check via mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The proposed method was shown to be effective and fast for networks with up to 240 neurons, with the computational complexity dominated by inverse operations on matrices that scale linearly in size with the number of neurons and complexity of input and unsafe sets. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by training a forward-invariant neural network controller for an affine dynamical system with a non-convex input set, as well as generating safe reach-avoid plans for a black-box dynamical system.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

A standard approach is to construct a finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These abstractions enable the synthesis of policies for the concrete nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Our numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics. This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |

We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant, this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d. random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components, representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics. We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of participating clients increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Scale Coupling Between States and Parameters in Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12121v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control information flow, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam. Empirical simulations corroborate these claims: in several sequence tasks, we show that gates induce lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional concentration of gradient flow, with multi-gate models matching or exceeding the anisotropic structure produced by Adam. These results highlight that optimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity are complementary but not equivalent mechanisms. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>forma...</summary><p>formatting and more simulations</p></details> |

The answer for $\mathbb{N}_0$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$ is given by a theorem of de Bruijn. We describe a family of natural candidate collections for $\mathbb{Z}$, which we call canonical collections. Translating the problem into the language of dynamical systems, we show that the question of whether the sumset of a canonical collection covers the entire $\mathbb{Z}$ is difficult: specifically, there is a collection for which this question is equivalent to the Collatz conjecture, and there is a well-behaved family of collections for which this question is equivalent to the universal halting problem for Fractran and is therefore undecidable.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To reduce the computational cost of the frequency-variable elliptic equations, we extend the variable-separation-based domain decomposition method to the complex-valued context, resulting in an offline-online procedure for solving the parametric dynamical systems. In the offline stage, separate representations of the solutions for the interface problem and the subproblems are constructed. In the online stage for new parameter values, the solutions of the parametric dynamical systems can be directly derived by utilizing the separate representations and implementing the inverse Fourier transform. The proposed approach is capable of being highly efficient because the online stage is independent of the spatial discretization. Finally, we present three specific instances for parametric dynamical systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 22 pages, 18 figures |
| **[One Equation to Rule Them All -- Part I: Direct Data-Driven Cascade Stabilisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17248v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article we present a framework for direct data-driven control for general problems involving interconnections of dynamical systems. We first develop a method to determine the solution of a Sylvester equation from data. Such solution is used to describe a subspace that plays a role in a large variety of problems. We then provide an error analysis of the impact that noise has on this solution. This is a crucial contribution because, thanks to the interconnection approach developed throughout the article, we are able to track how the noise propagates at each stage, and thereby provide bounds on the final designs. Among the many potential problems that can be solved with this framework, we focus on three representatives: cascade stabilisation, model order reduction, and output regulation. This manuscript studies the first problem, while the companion Part II addresses the other two. For each of these settings we show how the problems can be recast in our framework. In the context of cascade stabilisation, we consider the 2-cascade problem, the effect of noise through the cascade, as well as N-cascade case, and we demonstrate that our proposed method is data efficient. The proposed designs are illustrated by means of a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Dynamics meets Linear MDPs: Closed-Form Optimal Policies via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17185v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications -- including power systems, robotics, and economics -- involve a dynamical system interacting with a stochastic and hard-to-model environment. We adopt a reinforcement learning approach to control such systems. Specifically, we consider a deterministic, discrete-time, linear, time-invariant dynamical system coupled with a feature-based linear Markov process with an unknown transition kernel. The objective is to learn a control policy that optimizes a quadratic cost over the system state, the Markov process, and the control input. Leveraging both components of the system, we derive an explicit parametric form for the optimal state-action value function and the corresponding optimal policy. Our model is distinct in combining aspects of both classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and linear Markov decision process (MDP) frameworks. This combination retains the implementation simplicity of LQR, while allowing for sophisticated stochastic modeling afforded by linear MDPs, without estimating the transition probabilities, thereby enabling direct policy improvement. We use tools from control theory to provide theoretical guarantees on the stability of the system under the learned policy and provide a sample complexity analysis for its convergence to the optimal policy. We illustrate our results via a numerical example that demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in learning the optimal control policy under partially known stochastic dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Propagation Networks for Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16815v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>correcting authorship footnote, reformatting figures</p></details> |
| **[Learning Noise-Robust Stable Koopman Operator for Control with Hankel DMD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06607v6)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a noise-robust learning framework for the Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems, with guaranteed long-term stability and improved model performance for better model-based predictive control tasks. Unlike some existing approaches that rely on ad hoc observables or black-box neural networks in extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our framework leverages observables generated by the system dynamics, when the system dynamics is known, through a Hankel matrix, which shares similarities with discrete Polyflow. When system dynamics is unknown, we approximate them with a neural network while maintaining structural similarities to discrete Polyflow. To enhance noise robustness and ensure long-term stability, we developed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator, along with a progressive learning strategy for rollout loss. To further improve the performance of the model in the phase space, a simple iterative data augmentation strategy was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[PIANO: Physics Informed Autoregressive Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16235v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Adaptive Modeling in Process Monitoring: Leveraging Sequence Encoders and Physics-Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14252v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs. However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN, enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Exit Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: enhancing accuracy and parsimony](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03302v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize and interpret. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning-to-exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Dynamical Systems Framework for Reinforcement Learning Safety and Robustness Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15588v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty. Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that appear successful based on reward alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Convex Optimization and Integral Quadratic Constraints: An automated approach to regret analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23600v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Abstraction and Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Unknown Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15543v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Solvable Molecular Switch Model for Stable Temporal Information Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15451v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus, the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, submitted for publication.

| **[Bayesian Inference and Learning in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: A Framework for Incorporating Explicit and Implicit Prior Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15345v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task. This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge. The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including an experimental data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, Preprint submitted to Automatica</p></details> |
| **[A Time Splitting Based Optimization Method for Nonlinear MHE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23324v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving Horizon Estimation~(MHE) is essentially an optimization-based approach designed to estimate the states of dynamic systems within a moving time horizon. Traditional MHE solutions become computationally prohibitive due to the \textit{curse of dimensionality} arising from increasing problem complexity and growing length of time horizon. To address this issue, we propose novel computationally efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear MHE problems. Specifically, we first introduce a distributed reformulation utilizing a time-splitting technique. Leveraging this reformulation, we develop the Efficient Gauss-Newton Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) to achieve computational efficiency. Additionally, to accommodate limited computational capabilities inherent in some sub-problem solvers, we propose the Efficient Sensitivity Assisted ALADIN, which enables sub-problems to be solved inexactly without hindering computational efficiency. Furthermore, recognizing scenarios where sub-problem solvers possess no computational power, we propose a Distributed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that relies solely on first- and second-order information of local objective functions. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on differential drive robots case, a practical nonlinear MHE problem. Our results demonstrate that the three proposed algorithms achieve computational efficiency while preserving high accuracy, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of MHE.</p></details> |  |
