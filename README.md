| **[Quantum Generative Models for Computational Fluid Dynamics: A First Exploration of Latent Space Learning in Lattice Boltzmann Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22672v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first application of quantum generative models to learned latent space representations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysicsCorrect: A Training-Free Approach for Stable Neural PDE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02227v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation: error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three representative PDE systems, including Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity demanded by practical scientific applications.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[Safe Path Planning and Observation Quality Enhancement Strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Water Quality Monitoring Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21375v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing scientific reasoning benchmarks which focus on conceptual knowledge, or software engineering benchmarks that emphasize generic feature implementation and issue resolving, AInsteinBench evaluates models in end-to-end scientific development settings grounded in production-grade scientific repositories. The benchmark consists of tasks derived from maintainer-authored pull requests across six widely used scientific codebases, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum computing, molecular dynamics, numerical relativity, fluid dynamics, and cheminformatics. All benchmark tasks are carefully curated through multi-stage filtering and expert review to ensure scientific challenge, adequate test coverage, and well-calibrated difficulty. By leveraging evaluation in executable environments, scientifically meaningful failure modes, and test-driven verification, AInsteinBench measures a model's ability to move beyond surface-level code generation toward the core competencies required for computational scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Inference for Model Rocket Aerodynamics: Learning to Estimate Physical Parameters from Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22248v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of model rocket flight performance requires estimating aerodynamic parameters that are difficult to measure directly. Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and adoption in the amateur rocketry community.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Self-Guided Diffusion Model for Accelerating Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04375v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning methods, such as diffusion models, are widely explored as a promising way to accelerate high-fidelity fluid dynamics computation via a super-resolution process from faster-to-compute low-fidelity input. However, existing approaches usually make impractical assumptions that the low-fidelity data is down-sampled from high-fidelity data. In reality, low-fidelity data is produced by numerical solvers that use a coarser resolution. Solver-generated low-fidelity data usually sacrifices fine-grained details, such as small-scale vortices compared to high-fidelity ones. Our findings show that SOTA diffusion models struggle to reconstruct fine-scale details when faced with solver-generated low-fidelity inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose SG-Diff, a novel diffusion model for reconstruction, where both low-fidelity inputs and high-fidelity targets are generated from numerical solvers. We propose an \textit{Importance Weight} strategy during training that serves as a form of self-guidance, focusing on intricate fluid details, and a \textit{Predictor-Corrector-Advancer} SDE solver that embeds physical guidance into the diffusion sampling process. Together, these techniques steer the diffusion model toward more accurate reconstructions. Experimental results on four 2D turbulent flow datasets demonstrate the efficacy of \model~against state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SPUMA: a minimally invasive approach to the GPU porting of OPENFOAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22215v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High Performance Computing (HPC) on hybrid clusters represents a significant opportunity for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), especially when modern accelerators are utilized effectively. However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI. Notably, efficiency is no lower than 90% when switching to the NVIDIA AmgX linear algebra solver. Our tests also reveal that one A100 GPU on Leonardo is equivalent 200-300 Intel Sapphire Rapids cores, provided the GPUs are sufficiently oversubscribed (more than 10 million of cells per GPU). Finally, energy consumption is reduced by up to 82% compared to analogous simulations executed on CPUs.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[A Surrogate-Augmented Symbolic CFD-Driven Training Framework for Accelerating Multi-objective Physical Model Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19031v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-driven training combines machine learning (ML) with CFD solvers to develop physically consistent closure models with improved predictive accuracy. In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[HydroGym: A Reinforcement Learning Platform for Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17534v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and controlling fluid flows is critical for several fields of science and engineering, including transportation, energy, and medicine. Effective flow control can lead to, e.g., lift increase, drag reduction, mixing enhancement, and noise reduction. However, controlling a fluid faces several significant challenges, including high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale interactions in space and time. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, but its application to flow control is hindered by a lack of standardized benchmark platforms and the computational demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym, a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates sophisticated flow control benchmarks, scalable runtime infrastructure, and state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Our platform includes 42 validated environments spanning from canonical laminar flows to complex three-dimensional turbulent scenarios, validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We provide non-differentiable solvers for traditional RL and differentiable solvers that dramatically improve sample efficiency through gradient-enhanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes. The HydroGym platform is highly extensible and scalable, providing a framework for researchers in fluid dynamics, machine learning, and control to add environments, surrogate models, and control algorithms to advance science and technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Interferometer Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16051v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown tremendous promise in solving problems in high energy physics, materials science, and fluid dynamics. In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Particle Image Velocimetry Refinement via Consensus ADMM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11695v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an imaging technique in experimental fluid dynamics that quantifies flow fields around bluff bodies by analyzing the displacement of neutrally buoyant tracer particles immersed in the fluid. Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/flowgym</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning Framework for Thrombosis Risk Prediction in Rotary Blood Pumps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15761v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blood Pressure Prediction for Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10765v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[MFC 5.0: An exascale many-physics flow solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07953v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems of interest in engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences rely on high-fidelity flow simulation, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers a mainstay of the open-source software community. Previous work, MFC 3.0, was published, documented, and made open-source by Bryngelson et al. CPC (2021) features numerous physical features, numerical methods, and scalable infrastructure. MFC 5.0 is a significant update to MFC 3.0, featuring a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods, as well as the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF's Frontier and LLNL's El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-accelerator performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice and has achieved the largest-to-date public CFD simulation at 200 trillion grid points, earning it a 2025 ACM Gordon Bell Prize finalist. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF's Summit and Frontier, and LLNL's El Capitan, achieves efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-fold increase in device count show parallel efficiencies exceeding 90% on OLCF Frontier.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SynthPix supports the same configuration parameters as existing tools but achieves a throughput several orders of magnitude higher in image-pair generation per second. SynthPix was developed to enable the training of data-hungry reinforcement learning methods for flow estimation and for reducing the iteration times during the development of fast flow estimation methods used in recent active fluids control studies with real-time PIV feedback. We believe SynthPix to be useful for the fluid dynamics community, and in this paper we describe the main ideas behind this software package.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/synthpix</p></details> |
| **[Rates and architectures for learning geometrically non-trivial operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09376v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive. We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields. This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Urban Flow Modeling: From Geometry to Airflow with Graph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14725v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViSA: 3D-Aware Video Shading for Real-Time Upper-Body Avatar Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07720v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

| **[CFD-copilot: leveraging domain-adapted large language model and model context protocol to enhance simulation automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07917v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations requires significant expertise in physics modeling and numerical methods, posing a barrier to non-specialists. Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil.

This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with moving interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation: A Perspective from Computational Fluid Dynamics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01319v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx. Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit. Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p></details> |  |

We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22819v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |

However, building accurate surrogate models still requires a large number of expensive simulations. To address this challenge, we introduce epsilon HQS, a scalable active learning strategy that leverages a student teacher framework to train deep neural networks efficiently. Unlike Bayesian AL methods, which are computationally demanding with DNNs, epsilon HQS selectively queries informative samples to reduce labeling cost. Applied to CFD, FEA, and propeller design tasks, our method achieves higher accuracy under fixed labeling cost budgets.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |

| **[Active inference and artificial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Convex-Inspired Neural Construction for Structured and Generalizable Nonlinear Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18241v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time simulation of deformable objects relies on model reduction to achieve interactive performance while maintaining physical fidelity. Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions. We evaluate our method on challenging deformation scenarios involving forces of different magnitudes, inverse directions, and sparsely sampled training data. Our approach demonstrates superior generalization while maintaining compact reduced spaces, and supports real-time interactive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Dynamic Shape Control of Soft Robots Enabled by Data-Driven Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03931v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map. This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Filtered Neural Galerkin model reduction schemes for efficient propagation of initial condition uncertainties in digital twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00670v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification in digital twins is critical to enable reliable and credible predictions beyond available data. A key challenge is that ensemble-based approaches can become prohibitively expensive when embedded in control and data assimilation loops in digital twins, even when reduced models are used. We introduce a reduced modeling approach that advances in time the mean and covariance of the reduced solution distribution induced by the initial condition uncertainties, which eliminates the need to maintain and propagate a costly ensemble of reduced solutions. The mean and covariance dynamics are obtained as a moment closure from Neural Galerkin schemes on pre-trained neural networks, which can be interpreted as filtered Neural Galerkin dynamics analogous to Gaussian filtering and the extended Kalman filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that filtered Neural Galerkin schemes achieve more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to ensemble-based uncertainty propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Latent Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20615v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning Nonlinear Causal Reductions to Explain Reinforcement Learning Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14901v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |

| **[mLaSDI: Multi-stage latent space dynamics identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09207v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential across many scientific disciplines. However, high-fidelity solvers can be computationally prohibitive, motivating the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the training data via an autoencoder and learns user-specified ordinary differential equations (ODEs), governing the latent dynamics, enabling rapid predictions for unseen parameters. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous problems, the autoencoder must simultaneously reconstruct the training data and satisfy the imposed latent dynamics, which are often competing objectives that limit accuracy, particularly for complex or high-frequency phenomena. To address this limitation, we propose multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, we train LaSDI sequentially in stages. After training the initial autoencoder, we train additional decoders which map the latent trajectories to residuals from previous stages. This staged residual learning, combined with periodic activation functions, enables recovery of high-frequency content without sacrificing interpretability of the latent dynamics. Numerical experiments on a multiscale oscillating system, unsteady wake flow, and the 1D-1V Vlasov equation demonstrate that mLaSDI achieves significantly lower reconstruction and prediction errors, often by an order of magnitude, while requiring less training time and reduced hyperparameter tuning compared to standard LaSDI.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reduced Order Modeling for Tsunami Forecasting with Bayesian Hierarchical Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19804v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v7)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, SPIGM workshop at NeurIPS 2025, https://openreview.net/forum?id=IT9lF59UqG&noteId=IT9lF59UqG</p></details> |

Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 38 pages, 14 figures |

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Updating of constitutive parameters under hybrid uncertainties with a novel surrogate model applied to biofilms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15145v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Speed: A Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Machine Learning Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12276v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Learning at Machine Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19980v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |

The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS). 12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Learning Stochastic Multiscale Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22655v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly from observational data. Drawing inspiration from physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, we resolve the macroscale state on a coarse mesh while introducing a microscale latent state to explicitly model unresolved dynamics. We learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a simulator-free amortized variational inference method with a Product of Experts likelihood that enforces scale separation. We present detailed numerical studies to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to under-resolved direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at equivalent resolution, as well as reduced-order modeling approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Experiments were carried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under both irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, 1 box</p></details> |

However, their opaque inner workings often constitute an obstacle to physical interpretability. This work introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a novel FNO-based architecture tailored for reduced-order modeling of turbulent fluid flows, designed to enhance interpretability by explicitly separating fluid behavior across scales. The proposed architecture processes wavenumber bins in parallel, enabling the approximation of dispersion relations and non-linear interactions. Inputs are lifted to a higher-dimensional space, Fourier-transformed, and partitioned into wavenumber bins. Each bin is processed by a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), with outputs subsequently padded, summed, and inverse-transformed back into physical space. A final transformation refines the output in physical space as a correction model, by means of one of the following architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Echo State Network (ESN). We evaluate the proposed model on a series of increasingly complex dynamical systems: first on the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, then on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and finally on the prediction of wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow, given the near-wall velocity field. In all test cases, the model demonstrates its ability to decompose turbulent flows across various scales, opening up the possibility of increased interpretability and multiscale modeling of such flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Simulations of nonlinear structures, such as soft-bodied robots modeled using the finite element method (FEM), often demand substantial computational resources, especially during optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel optimization algorithm based on a tensorial parametric reduced order model (PROM). Our algorithm leverages dimensionality reduction and solution approximation techniques to facilitate efficient solving of nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The well-structured tensorial approach enables the use of analytical gradients within a specifically chosen reduced order basis (ROB), significantly enhancing computational efficiency. To showcase the performance of our method, we apply it to optimizing soft robotic swimmer shapes. These actuated soft robots experience hydrodynamic forces, subjecting them to both internal and external nonlinear forces, which are incorporated into our optimization process using a data-free ROB for fast and accurate computations. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also unlocks new opportunities to optimize complex nonlinear systems in soft robotics, paving the way for more efficient design and control.</p></details> |  |

Unlike data-driven approaches, this method operates directly on the governing equations, eliminating the need for full-order simulations. The proposed model is computed at a single value of the bifurcation parameter yet remains valid over a range of values. The approach systematically constructs an invariant manifold and embedded dynamics, providing an accurate and efficient reduction of the original system. The ability to capture pre-critical steady states, the bifurcation point, and post-critical limit cycle oscillations is demonstrated by a strong agreement between the reduced order model and full order simulations, while achieving significant computational speed-up.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Reduced Order Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs via Differentiable Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14595v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics. Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($Φ$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $Φ$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across various PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation that is readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers, available at https://phi-rom.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p></details> |  |

Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |

We estimate local patches of the covariance surface and then check whether the directional derivative in the $(1,1,0)$ direction is zero on each patch. The method only requires the covariance function to be locally smooth and does not assume stationarity in advance. It can be applied to general stochastic dynamical systems and provides a time-resolved view. We apply the test method to an SDOF system and to a stochastic Duffing oscillator. These examples show that the method is numerically stable and can detect departures from WSS in practice.</p></details> |  |

This design autonomously steers the unicycle dynamic system towards the extremum point of an objective function or physical/scalar signal that is unknown expression-wise, but accessible via measurements. A key contribution of this paper is that the introduced design converges exponentially to the extremum point of objective functions (or scalar signals) that behave locally like a higher-degree power function (e.g., fourth-degree polynomial function) as opposed to locally quadratic objective functions, the usual case in literature. We provide theoretical results and design characterization, supported by a variety of simulation results that demonstrate the robustness of the proposed design, including cases with different initial conditions and measurement delays/noise. Also, for the first time in the literature, we provide experimental robotic results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and its exponential convergence ability.</p></details> |  |

By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the pathwise expression is for the parameter-derivative of the marginal or stationary density, not an averaged observable. Our formula works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a Monte-Carlo algorithm for linear responses. We develop a new framework of generative models, DK-SDE, where the model is a parameterized SDE, that (1) directly uses the KL divergence between the empirical data distribution and the marginal density of the SDE as the training objective, and (2) accommodates parametrizations in both drift and diffusion over a long time span, allowing prior structural knowledge to be incorporated explicitly. The optimization is done by gradient-descent enabled by the divergence-kernel method, which involves only forward processes and therefore substantially reduces memory cost.

| **[Verification of Linear Dynamical Systems via O-Minimality of the Real Numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13053v4)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A discrete-time linear dynamical system (LDS) is given by an update matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, and has the trajectories $\langle s, Ms, M^2s, \ldots \rangle$ for $s \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Reachability-type decision problems of linear dynamical systems, most notably the Skolem Problem, lie at the forefront of decidability: typically, sound and complete algorithms are known only in low dimensions, and these rely on sophisticated tools from number theory and Diophantine approximation. Recently, however, o-minimality has emerged as a counterpoint to these number-theoretic tools that allows us to decide certain modifications of the classical problems of LDS without any dimension restrictions. In this paper, we first introduce the Decomposition Method, a framework that captures all applications of o-minimality to decision problems of LDS that are currently known to us. We then use the Decomposition Method to show decidability of the Robust Safety Problem (restricted to bounded initial sets) in arbitrary dimension: given a matrix $M$, a bounded semialgebraic set $S$ of initial points, and a semialgebraic set $T$ of unsafe points, it is decidable whether there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that all orbits that begin in the $\varepsilon$-ball around $S$ avoid $T$.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICALP...</summary><p>ICALP2025 paper with few corrections</p></details> |
| **[Effective Game-Theoretic Motion Planning via Nested Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08001v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To facilitate effective, safe deployment in the real world, individual robots must reason about interactions with other agents, which often occur without explicit communication. Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version.

| **[Ambiguous Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19810v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular, this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems, recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines for discrete tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22784v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical Ising machines are continuous dynamical systems that evolve from a generic initial state to a state strongly related to the ground state of the classical Ising model. We show that such a machine driven by the V${}_2$ dynamical model can solve exactly discrete tomography problems about reconstructing a binary image from the pixel sums along a discrete set of rays. In contrast to usual applications of Ising machines, targeting approximate solutions to optimization problems, the randomly initialized V${}_2$ model converges with high probability ($P_{\mathrm{succ}} \approx 1$) to an image precisely satisfying the tomographic data. For the problems with at most two rays intersecting at each pixel, the V${}_2$ model converges in internal machine time that depends only weakly on the image size. Our consideration is an example of how specific dynamical systems can produce exact solutions to highly non-trivial data processing tasks. Crucially, this solving capability arises from the dynamical features of the V${}_2$ model itself, in particular its equations of motion that enable non-local transitions of the discrete component of the relaxed spin beyond Hamming-neighborhood constraints, rather than from merely recasting the tomography problem in spin form.</p></details> | 21 pages; 6 figures |
| **[HopCast: Calibration of Autoregressive Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16587v5)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are often trained to approximate dynamical systems that can be modeled using differential equations. Many of these models are optimized to predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step predictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep Ensembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via autoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce calibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative Predictor-Corrector approach named \hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the dynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's output based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set of errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher predictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The calibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical systems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty propagation methods based on calibration errors.</p></details> |  |

| **[Safe Path Planning and Observation Quality Enhancement Strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Water Quality Monitoring Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21375v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mechanistic Analysis of Transformers for Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21113v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning Modeling and Control of Non-linear Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21081v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness Certificates for Neural Networks against Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20865v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Simulation-based Generative Model for Imperfect Data (SiGMoID) that enables precise and robust inference for dynamic systems. The proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components. Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental examples, showcasing its broad applicability in various domains, from scientific research to engineered systems, and enabling the discovery of full system dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, AAAI2026 (paper id: 20546)</p></details> |
| **[Similarity Field Theory: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218v4)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p=(X_p,S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_α(K)={E\in U \mid S(E,K)\ge α}$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E):=S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. At a high level, this framework reframes intelligence and interpretability as geometric problems on similarity fields--preserving and composing level-set fibers--rather than purely statistical ones. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability implies either an anchor coordinate or asymptotic confinement to the target level (up to arbitrarily small tolerance). Together, these results constrain similarity-field evolution and motivate an interpretive lens that can be applied to large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Efficient Adjustment for Micro Causal Effects in Summary Causal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18315v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observational studies in fields such as epidemiology often rely on covariate adjustment to estimate causal effects. Classical graphical criteria, like the back-door criterion and the generalized adjustment criterion, are powerful tools for identifying valid adjustment sets in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, these criteria are not directly applicable to summary causal graphs (SCGs), which are abstractions of DAGs commonly used in dynamic systems. In SCGs, each node typically represents an entire time series and may involve cycles, making classical criteria inapplicable for identifying causal effects. Recent work established complete conditions for determining whether the micro causal effect of a treatment or an exposure $X_{t-γ}$ on an outcome $Y_t$ is identifiable via covariate adjustment in SCGs, under the assumption of no hidden confounding. However, these identifiability conditions have two main limitations. First, they are complex, relying on cumbersome definitions and requiring the enumeration of multiple paths in the SCG, which can be computationally expensive. Second, when these conditions are satisfied, they only provide two valid adjustment sets, limiting flexibility in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an equivalent but simpler formulation of those identifiability conditions and introduce a new criterion that identifies a broader class of valid adjustment sets in SCGs. Additionally, we characterize the quasi-optimal adjustment set among these, i.e., the one that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the causal effect estimator. Our contributions offer both theoretical advancement and practical tools for more flexible and efficient causal inference in abstracted causal graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655v4)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by physics-inspired approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |

This formulation, which we call EvoGS, treats the Gaussian representation as an evolving physical system whose state evolves continuously under a learned motion law. This unlocks capabilities absent in deformation-based approaches:(1) sample-efficient learning from sparse temporal supervision by modeling the underlying motion law; (2) temporal extrapolation enabling forward and backward prediction beyond observed time ranges; and (3) compositional dynamics that allow localized dynamics injection for controllable scene synthesis. Experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show that EvoGS achieves better motion coherence and temporal consistency compared to deformation-field baselines while maintaining real-time rendering</p></details> |  |
| **[An Inverse Scattering Inspired Fourier Neural Operator for Time-Dependent PDE Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19439v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning accurate and stable time-advancement operators for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging, particularly for chaotic, stiff, and long-horizon dynamical systems. While neural operator methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Koopman-inspired extensions achieve good short-term accuracy, their long-term stability is often limited by unconstrained latent representations and cumulative rollout errors. In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research Program: Theory of Learning in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19410v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern learning systems increasingly interact with data that evolve over time and depend on hidden internal state. We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems.</p></details> |  |

Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor. Previous work has shown that transfer learning can be used effectively with ESNs for single-orbit prediction. The novelty of our paper lies in our use of this pairing to predict the long-term statistical properties of spatiotemporally chaotic PDEs. We also show that transfer learning nontrivially improves the length of time that predictions of individual gKS trajectories remain accurate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Merge on workspaces as Hopf algebra Markov chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18861v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the dynamical properties of a Hopf algebra Markov chain with state space the binary rooted forests with labelled leaves. This Markovian dynamical system describes the core computational process of structure formation and transformation in syntax via the Merge operation, according to Chomsky's Minimalism model of generative linguistics. The dynamics decomposes into an ergodic dynamical system with uniform stationary distribution, given by the action of Internal Merge, while the contributions of External Merge and (a minimal form of) Sideward Merge reduce to a simpler Markov chain with state space the set of partitions and with combinatorial weights. The Sideward Merge part of the dynamics prevents convergence to fully formed connected structures (trees), unless the different forms of Merge are weighted by a cost function, as predicted by linguistic theory. Results on the asymptotic behavior of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector in this weighted case, obtained in terms of an associated Perron-Frobenius problem in the tropical semiring, show that the usual cost functions (Minimal Search and Resource Restrictions) proposed in the linguistic literature do not suffice to obtain convergence to the tree structures, while an additional optimization property based on the Shannon entropy achieves the expected result for the dynamics. We also comment on the introduction of continuous parameters related to semantic embedding and other computational models, and also on some filtering of the dynamics by coloring rules that model the linguistic filtering by theta roles and phase structure, and on parametric variation and the process of parameter setting in Externalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>80 pa...</summary><p>80 pages, LaTeX, 1 png figure</p></details> |

Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.</p></details> | 38 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Comparing Dynamical Models Through Diffeomorphic Vector Field Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18566v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 18 figures.

| **[ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290v3)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Neural Proofs for Sound Verification and Control of Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18389v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This informal contribution presents an ongoing line of research that is pursuing a new approach to the construction of sound proofs for the formal verification and control of complex stochastic models of dynamical systems, of reactive programs and, more generally, of models of Cyber-Physical Systems. Neural proofs are made up of two key components: 1) proof rules encode requirements entailing the verification of general temporal specifications over the models of interest; and 2) certificates that discharge such rules, namely they are constructed from said proof rules with an inductive (that is, cyclic, repetitive) approach; this inductive approach involves: 2a) accessing samples from the model's dynamics and accordingly training neural networks, whilst 2b) generalising such networks via SAT-modulo-theory (SMT) queries that leverage the full knowledge of the models. In the context of sequential decision making problems over complex stochastic models, it is possible to additionally generate provably-correct policies/strategies/controllers, namely state-feedback functions that, in conjunction with neural certificates, formally attain the given specifications for the models of interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation and learning with compositional tensor trains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18059v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce compositional tensor trains (CTTs) for the approximation of multivariate functions, a class of models obtained by composing low-rank functions in the tensor-train format. This format can encode standard approximation tools, such as (sparse) polynomials, deep neural networks (DNNs) with fixed width, or tensor networks with arbitrary permutation of the inputs, or more general affine coordinate transformations, with similar complexities. This format can be viewed as a DNN with width exponential in the input dimension and structured weights matrices. Compared to DNNs, this format enables controlled compression at the layer level using efficient tensor algebra. On the optimization side, we derive a layerwise algorithm inspired by natural gradient descent, allowing to exploit efficient low-rank tensor algebra. This relies on low-rank estimations of Gram matrices, and tensor structured random sketching. Viewing the format as a discrete dynamical system, we also derive an optimization algorithm inspired by numerical methods in optimal control. Numerical experiments on regression tasks demonstrate the expressivity of the new format and the relevance of the proposed optimization algorithms. Overall, CTTs combine the expressivity of compositional models with the algorithmic efficiency of tensor algebra, offering a scalable alternative to standard deep neural networks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Neural CDEs as Correctors for Learned Time Series Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12116v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned time-series models, whether continuous- or discrete-time, are widely used to forecast the states of a dynamical system. Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributionally Robust Imitation Learning: Layered Control Architecture for Certifiable Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17899v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) enables autonomous behavior by learning from expert demonstrations. While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. To enable certifiable IL for learned and/or uncertain dynamical systems, we formulate \textit{Distributionally Robust Imitation Policy (DRIP)} architecture, a Layered Control Architecture (LCA) that integrates TaSIL and~\ellonedrac. By judiciously designing individual layer-centric input and output requirements, we show how we can guarantee certificates for the entire control pipeline. Our solution paves the path for designing fully certifiable autonomy pipelines, by integrating learning-based components, such as perception, with certifiable model-based decision-making through the proposed LCA approach.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Systems-Theoretic View on the Convergence of Algorithms under Disturbances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17598v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASecond-Order SpikingSSM for Wearables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks have garnered increasing attention due to their energy efficiency, multiplication-free computation, and sparse event-based processing. In parallel, state space models have emerged as scalable alternatives to transformers for long-range sequence modelling by avoiding quadratic dependence on sequence length. We propose SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate-and-Fire State Space Model), a second-order spiking SSM for classification and regression on ultra-long sequences. SHaRe-SSM outperforms transformers and first-order SSMs on average while eliminating matrix multiplications, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained applications. To ensure fast computation over tens of thousands of time steps, we leverage a parallel scan formulation of the underlying dynamical system. Furthermore, we introduce a kernel-based spiking regressor, which enables the accurate modelling of dependencies in sequences of up to 50k steps. Our results demonstrate that SHaRe-SSM achieves superior long-range modelling capability with energy efficiency (52.1x less than ANN-based second order SSM), positioning it as a strong candidate for resource-constrained devices such as wearables</p></details> |  |
| **[Thermodynamics a la Souriau on Kähler Non Compact Symmetric Spaces for Cartan Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16772v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {à} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.</p></details> | 108 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Gated KalmaNet: A Fading Memory Layer Through Test-Time Ridge Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21016v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear State-Space Models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall-oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that accounts for the full past while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. We ground our approach in the Kalman Filter (KF) framework, which provides a principled solution for optimal inference in dynamical systems. We show that several existing SSM layers (DeltaNet, Gated DeltaNet, and Kimi Delta Attention) are approximations to the KF recurrence that assume identity error covariance, thereby ignoring how past measurements (keys and values) should optimally influence state updates. In contrast, GKA computes the exact Kalman gain by maintaining the full error covariance. Under a steady-state assumption that enables parallelization, this reduces to solving an online ridge regression problem with constant memory and linear compute cost. A critical insight is that standard KF equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and hard to parallelize on modern hardware. We address this through: (1) adaptive regularization with input-dependent gating to control the condition number of the ridge regression for numerical stability, and (2) Chebyshev Iteration, which we show is more stable than conventional iterative solvers in low-precision settings. We further develop hardware-aware chunk-wise kernels to enable efficient training. Empirically, GKA outperforms existing SSM layers (like Mamba2 and Gated DeltaNet) on short-context tasks and achieves more than 10\% relative improvement on long-context RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Can Transformers overcome the lack of data in the simulation of history-dependent flows?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16305v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that the lack of information about certain variables necessary for the description of a dynamical system leads to the introduction of historical dependence (lack of Markovian character of the model) and noise. Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance.</p></details> |  |

The novel insight is that the spectral structure required for accelerated Wasserstein gradient descent can be directly estimated from trajectory data via Koopman operator approximation which can eliminate the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential or neural network training. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and establish connection to Feynman-Kac theory that clarifies the method's probabilistic foundation. Experiments across diverse settings, including compact manifold sampling, metastable multi-well systems, image generation, and high dimensional stochastic partial differential equation, demonstrate that KSWGD consistently achieves faster convergence than other existing methods while maintaining high sample quality.</p></details> |  |

Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},ω)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case. The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages: 49 pages + Appendix; Version 2: added remark (remark 5.28) in chapter 5 and corrected some typos/small logical mistakes</p></details> |

For deterministic systems, the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems. Even in stochastic systems, the delay-embedding technique is beneficial for partial observation, and several numerical experiments show a power-law behavior of error with respect to the amplitude of the additive noise. We also discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the effects of partial observation.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

The transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential dependencies. However, a naïve application of transformers often struggles to effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate against this, we propose a novel architecture, termed Spectral Operator Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of $47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of $2.2\%$ against the most competitive baseline. We further show that MVCA can remedy the deficiencies of naïve attention in various deep learning models, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$ on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for oral presentation at AAAI 2026.

| **[ReLaX: Reasoning with Latent Exploration for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07558v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, RLVR often leads to entropy collapse, resulting in premature policy convergence and performance saturation. While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural Koopman Machine for Interpretable Longitudinal Personalized Alzheimer's Disease Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06134v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early forecasting of individual cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is central to disease evaluation and management. Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($α$) and biological ($β$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules.

We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset available at: https://zenodo.org/records/17812071</p></details> |

This work presents a projection-based coarse-graining formalism for general underdamped Langevin dynamics. Following the Zwanzig projection approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the coarse grained dynamics. In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations. Using a two-dimensional model system, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to accurately capture the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the full-space model.</p></details> |  |
| **[KALIKO: Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator Learning For Prediction of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03256v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon dynamical prediction is fundamental in robotics and control, underpinning canonical methods like model predictive control. Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics. Evaluated on wave data generated by a high-dimensional PDE, KALIKO surpasses several baselines in open-loop prediction and in a demanding closed-loop simulated control task: stabilizing an underactuated manipulator's payload by predicting and compensating for strong wave disturbances.</p></details> |  |

We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the Hénon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nonlinearity</p></details> |
| **[Banach neural operator for Navier-Stokes equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09070v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical neural networks are known for their ability to approximate mappings between finite-dimensional spaces, but they fall short in capturing complex operator dynamics across infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators, in contrast, have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning for learning such mappings. However, standard neural operators typically lack mechanisms for mixing or attending to input information across space and time. In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In particular, BNO achieves robust zero-shot super-resolution in unsteady flow prediction and consistently outperforms conventional Koopman-based methods and deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the parametric uncertainty, the proposed MAKO approach can learn a meta-model from a multi-modal dataset and efficiently adapt to new systems with previously unseen parameter settings by using online data. Based on the learned meta Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control efficacy as compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15188v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven method to find a closed-loop optimal controller, which minimizes a specified infinite-horizon cost function for systems with unknown dynamics. Suppose the closed-loop optimal controller can be parameterized by a given class of functions, hereafter referred to as the policy. The proposed method introduces a novel gradient estimation framework, which approximates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters via integrating the Koopman operator with the classical concept of actor-critic. This enables the policy parameters to be tuned iteratively using gradient descent to achieve an optimal controller, leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator. The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is provided. The control performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations compared with classical optimal control methods that usually assume the dynamics are known.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168v6)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Online Learning of Deep Koopman Linear Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12760v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Conformal Online Learning of Koopman embeddings (COLoKe), a novel framework for adaptively updating Koopman-invariant representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from streaming data. Our modeling approach combines deep feature learning with multistep prediction consistency in the lifted space, where the dynamics evolve linearly. To prevent overfitting, COLoKe employs a conformal-style mechanism that shifts the focus from evaluating the conformity of new states to assessing the consistency of the current Koopman model. Updates are triggered only when the current model's prediction error exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold, allowing selective refinement of the Koopman operator and embedding. Empirical results on benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of COLoKe in maintaining long-term predictive accuracy while significantly reducing unnecessary updates and avoiding overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Digital Twin of Sheet Metal Forming via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Based Koopman Operator with Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10852v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Dictionary-Free Method for Identifying Linear Model of Nonlinear System with Input Delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04451v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Koopman Economic Model Predictive Control of a Pasteurisation Unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04437v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU). The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs, such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization, and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables. The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a 32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Koopman-based Prediction of Connectivity for Flying Ad Hoc Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01286v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of machine learning (ML) to communication systems is expected to play a pivotal role in future artificial intelligence (AI)-based next-generation wireless networks. While most existing works focus on ML techniques for static wireless environments, they often face limitations when applied to highly dynamic environments, such as flying ad hoc networks (FANETs). This paper explores the use of data-driven Koopman approaches to address these challenges. Specifically, we investigate how these approaches can model UAV trajectory dynamics within FANETs, enabling more accurate predictions and improved network performance. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we propose two possible approaches -- centralized and distributed -- to efficiently address the challenges posed by the constantly changing topology of FANETs. To demonstrate this, we consider a FANET performing surveillance with UAVs following pre-determined trajectories and predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) to ensure reliable communication between UAVs. Our results show that these approaches can accurately predict connectivity and isolation events that lead to modelled communication outages. This capability could help UAVs schedule their transmissions based on these predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing diffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal dependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating proprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the policy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually derived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep Koopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a dual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality combinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate task progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and proprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when the robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer handle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by the visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and facilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation learning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures structured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the test-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the aggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby enhancing the reliability of policy execution. In simulation experiments across six RLBench tabletop tasks, D3P outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion policy by an average of 14.6\%. On three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, it achieves a 15.0\% improvement.

We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Major revision of the manuscript to refine the narrative, clarify the model's theoretical limitations and application scope, and improve overall presentation for journal submission</p></details> |

Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Unfolding Generative Flows with Koopman Operators: Fast and Interpretable Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22304v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) enable elegant generative modeling but remain bottlenecked by slow sampling: producing a single sample requires solving a nonlinear ODE with hundreds of function evaluations. Recent approaches such as Rectified Flow and OT-CFM accelerate sampling by straightening trajectories, yet the learned dynamics remain nonlinear black boxes, limiting both efficiency and interpretability. We propose a fundamentally different perspective: globally linearizing flow dynamics via Koopman theory. By lifting Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) into a higher-dimensional Koopman space, we represent its evolution with a single linear operator. This yields two key benefits. First, sampling becomes one-step and parallelizable, computed in closed form via the matrix exponential. Second, the Koopman operator provides a spectral blueprint of generation, enabling novel interpretability through its eigenvalues and modes. We derive a practical, simulation-free training objective that enforces infinitesimal consistency with the teacher's dynamics and show that this alignment preserves fidelity along the full generative path, distinguishing our method from boundary-only distillation. Empirically, our approach achieves competitive sample quality with dramatic speedups, while uniquely enabling spectral analysis of generative flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Shapes Koopman Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17370v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Physics-Informed High-order Graph Dynamics Identification Learning for Predicting Complex Networks Long-term Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages double column; two figures</p></details> |

Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space. Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to linear problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the ACC2026 conference</p></details> |
| **[Safe Navigation of Bipedal Robots via Koopman Operator-Based Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14736v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinearity in dynamics has long been a major challenge in robotics, often causing significant performance degradation in existing control algorithms. For example, the navigation of bipedal robots can exhibit nonlinear behaviors even under simple velocity commands, as their actual dynamics are governed by complex whole-body movements and discrete contacts. In this work, we propose a novel safe navigation framework inspired by Koopman operator theory. We first train a low-level locomotion policy using deep reinforcement learning, and then capture its low-frequency, base-level dynamics by learning linearized dynamics in a high-dimensional lifted space using Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Then, our model-predictive controller (MPC) efficiently optimizes control signals via standard quadratic objective and the linear dynamics constraint in the lifted space. We demonstrate that the Koopman-based model more accurately predicts bipedal robot trajectories than baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show that the proposed navigation framework achieves improved safety with better success rates in dense environments with narrow passages.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Certified Neural Approximations of Nonlinear Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15497v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that our framework can successfully address additional scenarios previously intractable for existing methods - neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators for the purpose of trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>first...</summary><p>first and second author contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why High-rank Neural Networks Generalize?: An Algebraic Framework with RKHSs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21895v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Vector Field-Guided Learning Predictive Control for Motion Planning of Mobile Robots with Uncertain Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08283v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In obstacle-dense scenarios, providing safe guidance for mobile robots is critical to improve the safe maneuvering capability. However, the guidance provided by standard guiding vector fields (GVFs) may limit the motion capability due to the improper curvature of the integral curve when traversing obstacles. On the other hand, robotic system dynamics are often time-varying, uncertain, and even unknown during the motion planning process. Therefore, many existing kinodynamic motion planning methods could not achieve satisfactory reliability in guaranteeing safety. To address these challenges, we propose a two-level Vector Field-guided Learning Predictive Control (VF-LPC) approach that improves safe maneuverability. The first level, the guiding level, generates safe desired trajectories using the designed kinodynamic GVF, enabling safe motion in obstacle-dense environments. The second level, the Integrated Motion Planning and Control (IMPC) level, first uses a deep Koopman operator to learn a nominal dynamics model offline and then updates the model uncertainties online using sparse Gaussian processes (GPs). The learned dynamics and a game-based safe barrier function are then incorporated into the LPC framework to generate near-optimal planning solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments were conducted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, demonstrating that VF-LPC enables robots to maneuver safely.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Momenta-Based Koopman Formalism for Robust Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17010v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel Koopman operator formulation for Euler Lagrangian dynamics that employs an implicit generalized momentum-based state space representation, which decouples a known linear actuation channel from state dependent dynamics and makes the system more amenable to linear Koopman modeling. By leveraging this structural separation, the proposed formulation only requires to learn the unactuated dynamics rather than the complete actuation dependent system, thereby significantly reducing the number of learnable parameters, improving data efficiency, and lowering overall model complexity. In contrast, conventional explicit formulations inherently couple inputs with the state dependent terms in a nonlinear manner, making them more suitable for bilinear Koopman models, which are more computationally expensive to train and deploy. Notably, the proposed scheme enables the formulation of linear models that achieve superior prediction performance compared to conventional bilinear models while remaining substantially more efficient. To realize this framework, we present two neural network architectures that construct Koopman embeddings from actuated or unactuated data, enabling flexible and efficient modeling across different tasks. Robustness is ensured through the integration of a linear Generalized Extended State Observer (GESO), which explicitly estimates disturbances and compensates for them in real time. The combined momentum-based Koopman and GESO framework is validated through comprehensive trajectory tracking simulations and experiments on robotic manipulators, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and learning efficiency relative to state of the art alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[KoopCast: Trajectory Forecasting via Koopman Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15513v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present KoopCast, a lightweight yet efficient model for trajectory forecasting in general dynamic environments. Our approach leverages Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go. This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Online Residual Refinement via Koopman-Guided Dynamics Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12562v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising, model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge modern learning methods with classical control theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12080v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, current state-of-the-art continuum robots can only achieve real-time task-space control (i.e., tip control) but not whole-shape control, mainly due to the high computational cost from its infinite degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for the shape control of simulated multi-segment tendon-driven soft continuum robots with the Kirchhoff rod model. Using data collected from these simulated soft robots, we conduct a per-segment projection scheme on the state of the robots allowing for the identification of control-affine Koopman models that are an order of magnitude more accurate than without the projection scheme. Using these learned Koopman models, we use a linear model predictive control (MPC) to control the robots to a collection of target shapes of varying complexity. Our method realizes computationally efficient closed-loop control, and demonstrates the feasibility of real-time shape control for soft robots. We envision this work can pave the way for practical shape control of soft continuum robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (+2 pages of references), 8 figures</p></details> |

However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted and accepted to ICRA 2025.

| **[Physics-Based Machine Learning Closures and Wall Models for Hypersonic Transition-Continuum Boundary Layer Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08986v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling rarefied hypersonic flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the breakdown of classical continuum assumptions in the transition-continuum regime, where the Knudsen number ranges from approximately 0.1 to 10. Conventional Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) models with empirical slip-wall boundary conditions fail to accurately predict nonequilibrium effects such as velocity slip, temperature jump, and shock structure deviations. We develop a physics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models and boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in nonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs) for the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained via adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional supersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers. Additionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian approximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model replaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven boundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our results show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the skewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly improved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes. Strategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and inclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model generalization. Increasing model complexity yields diminishing returns for out-of-sample cases, underscoring the need to balance degrees of freedom and overfitting. This work establishes data-driven, physics-consistent strategies for improving hypersonic flow modeling for regimes in which conventional continuum approaches are invalid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Physics-Data Enrichments to Represent Uncertainty in Reduced Gas-Surface Chemistry Models for Hypersonic Flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08137v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During hypersonic flight, air reacts with a planetary re-entry vehicle's thermal protection system (TPS), creating reaction products that deplete the TPS. Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

Rapid and accurate prediction of external and internal flows accelerates design iterations. To this end, we develop a new variant of DeepONet, called Fusion-DeepONet as a fast surrogate model for geometry-dependent hypersonic and supersonic flow fields. We evaluated Fusion-DeepONet in learning two external hypersonic flows and a supersonic shape-dependent internal flow problem. First, we compare the performance of Fusion-DeepONet with state-of-the-art neural operators to learn inviscid hypersonic flow around semi-elliptic blunt bodies for two grid types: uniform Cartesian and irregular grids. Fusion-DeepONet provides comparable accuracy to parameter-conditioned U-Net on uniform grids while outperforming MeshGraphNet and Vanilla-DeepONet on irregular grids. Fusion-DeepONet requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than U-Net, MeshGraphNet, and FNO. For the second hypersonic problem, we set up Fusion-DeepONet to map from geometry and free stream Mach number to the temperature field around a reentry capsule traveling at hypersonic speed. This fast surrogate is then improved to predict the spatial derivative of the temperature, resulting in an accurate prediction of heat flux at the surfaces of the capsule. To enhance the accuracy of spatial derivative prediction, we introduce a derivative-enhanced loss term with the least computation overhead. For the third problem, we show that Fusion-DeepONet outperforms MeshGraphNet in learning geometry-dependent supersonic flow in a converging-diverging nozzle configuration. For all the problems, we used high-fidelity simulations with a high-order entropy-stable DGSEM solver to generate training datasets with limited samples.</p></details> |  |

Among these threats, hypersonic missiles pose a significant challenge due to their extreme speeds and maneuverability, making accurate trajectory prediction a critical necessity for effective countermeasures. This paper addresses this challenge by employing a novel hybrid deep learning approach, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). By leveraging the strengths of these architectures, the proposed method successfully predicts the complex trajectories of hypersonic missiles with high accuracy, offering a significant contribution to defense strategies and missile interception technologies. This research demonstrates the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing the predictive capabilities of defense systems.</p></details> |  |

Training scientific machine learning (SciML) models on limited high-fidelity data offers one approach to rapidly predict behaviors for situations that have not been seen before. However, high-fidelity data is itself in limited quantity to validate all outputs of the SciML model in unexplored input space. As such, an uncertainty-aware SciML model is desired. The SciML model's output uncertainties could then be used to assess the reliability and confidence of the model's predictions. In this study, we extend a DeepONet using three different uncertainty quantification mechanisms: mean-variance estimation, evidential uncertainty, and ensembling. The uncertainty aware DeepONet models are trained and evaluated on the hypersonic flow around a blunt cone object with data generated via computational fluid dynamics over a wide range of Mach numbers and altitudes. We find that ensembling outperforms the other two uncertainty models in terms of minimizing error and calibrating uncertainty in both interpolative and extrapolative regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted after peer-review and presented at the 2023 NeurIPS Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences workshop. https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/</p></details> |

The objective is to maximize the total value of destroyed targets in each episode. Each randomly generated episode varies the number and initial conditions of the hypersonic strike weapons (HSW) and targets, the value distribution of the targets, and the probability of a HSW being intercepted. We compare the performance of this WTA policy to that of a benchmark WTA policy derived using non-linear integer programming (NLIP), and find that the RL WTA policy gives near optimal performance with a 1000X speedup in computation time, allowing real time operation that facilitates autonomous decision making in the mission end game.</p></details> |  |

A first simulation gathers all relevant thermodynamic states and the corresponding gas properties via a given model. The states are embedded in a low-dimensional space and clustered to identify regions with different levels of thermochemical (non)-equilibrium. Then, a surrogate surface from the reduced cluster-space to the output space is generated using radial-basis-function networks. The method is validated and benchmarked on a simulation of a hypersonic flat-plate boundary layer with finite-rate chemistry. The gas properties of the reactive air mixture are initially modeled using the open-source Mutation++ library. Substituting Mutation++ with the light-weight, machine-learned alternative improves the performance of the solver by 50% while maintaining overall accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The PIROM consists of a physics-based analytical component that represents the known physical processes, and a data-driven dynamical component that represents the unknown physical processes. The PIROM is applied to the aerothermal load modeling for hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE) analysis and is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two-three orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Moreover, the PIROM-based solver is benchmarked against the conventional POD-kriging surrogate model, and is found to significantly outperform the accuracy, generalizability and sampling efficiency of the latter in a wide range of operating conditions and in the presence of complex structural boundary conditions. Finally, the PIROM-based ATE solver is demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary conditions and rib-supports on the ATE response of a compliant and heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the dramatic snap-through behavior with respect to spring constraints of boundary conditions, but also demonstrates the potential of PIROM to facilitate the rapid and accurate design and optimization of multi-disciplinary systems such as hypersonic structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating hypersonic reentry simulations using deep learning-based hybridization (with guarantees)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13434v2)** | 2022-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we are interested in the acceleration of numerical simulations. We focus on a hypersonic planetary reentry problem whose simulation involves coupling fluid dynamics and chemical reactions. Simulating chemical reactions takes most of the computational time but, on the other hand, cannot be avoided to obtain accurate predictions. We face a trade-off between cost-efficiency and accuracy: the simulation code has to be sufficiently efficient to be used in an operational context but accurate enough to predict the phenomenon faithfully. To tackle this trade-off, we design a hybrid simulation code coupling a traditional fluid dynamic solver with a neural network approximating the chemical reactions. We rely on their power in terms of accuracy and dimension reduction when applied in a big data context and on their efficiency stemming from their matrix-vector structure to achieve important acceleration factors ($\times 10$ to $\times 18.6$). This paper aims to explain how we design such cost-effective hybrid simulation codes in practice. Above all, we describe methodologies to ensure accuracy guarantees, allowing us to go beyond traditional surrogate modeling and to use these codes as references.</p></details> | Under review |

Public and private organizations in several countries have been investing in hypersonics, with the aim to overtake their competitors and secure/improve strategic advantage and deterrence. For these organizations, being able to identify emerging technologies in a timely and reliable manner is paramount. Recent advances in information technology have made it possible to analyze large amounts of data, extract hidden patterns, and provide decision-makers with new insights. In this study, we focus on scientific publications about hypersonics within the period of 2000-2020, and employ natural language processing and machine learning to characterize the research landscape by identifying 12 key latent research themes and analyzing their temporal evolution. Our publication similarity analysis revealed patterns that are indicative of cycles during two decades of research. The study offers a comprehensive analysis of the research field and the fact that the research themes are algorithmically extracted removes subjectivity from the exercise and enables consistent comparisons between topics and between time intervals.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Eilmer has a broad userbase in several university research groups and a wide range of capabilities, which are documented on the project's website, in the accompanying reference manuals, and in an extensive catalogue of example simulations. The first part of this paper describes the formulation of the code: the equations, physical models, and numerical methods that are used in a basic fluid dynamics simulation, as well as a handful of optional multi-physics models that are commonly added on to do calculations of hypersonic flow. The second section describes the processes used to develop and maintain the code, documenting our adherence to good programming practice and endorsing certain techniques that seem to be particularly helpful for scientific codes. The final section describes a half-dozen example simulations that span the range of Eilmer's capabilities, each consisting of some sample results and a short explanation of the problem being solved, which together will hopefully assist new users in beginning to use Eilmer in their own research projects.</p></details> |  |

The guidance system maps observations directly to commanded bank angle, angle of attack, and sideslip angle rates. Importantly, the observations are directly measurable from radar seeker outputs with minimal processing. The optimization framework implements a shaping reward that minimizes the line of sight rotation rate, with a terminal reward given if the agent satisfies path constraints and meets terminal accuracy and speed criteria. We show that the guidance system can adapt to off-nominal flight conditions including perturbation of aerodynamic coefficient parameters, actuator failure scenarios, sensor scale factor errors, and actuator lag, while satisfying heating rate, dynamic pressure, and load path constraints, as well as a minimum impact speed constraint. We demonstrate precision strike capability against a maneuvering ground target and the ability to divert to a new target, the latter being important to maximize strike effectiveness for a group of hypersonic strike weapons. Moreover, we demonstrate a threat evasion strategy against interceptors with limited midcourse correction capability, where the hypersonic strike weapon implements multiple diverts to alternate targets, with the last divert to the actual target. Finally, we include preliminary results for an integrated guidance and control system in a six degrees-of-freedom environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2107.14764; text overlap with arXiv:2109.03880</p></details> |

Adaptability is achieved by optimizing over a range of off-nominal flight conditions including perturbation of aerodynamic coefficient parameters, actuator failure scenarios, and sensor noise. The system maps observations directly to commanded bank angle and angle of attack rates. These observations include a velocity field tracking error formulated using parallel navigation, but adapted to work over long trajectories where the Earth's curvature must be taken into account. Minimizing the tracking error keeps the curved space line of sight to the target location aligned with the vehicle's velocity vector. The optimized guidance system will then induce trajectories that bring the vehicle to the target location with a high degree of accuracy at the designated terminal speed, while satisfying heating rate, load, and dynamic pressure constraints. We demonstrate the adaptability of the guidance system by testing over flight conditions that were not experienced during optimization. The guidance system's performance is then compared to that of a linear quadratic regulator tracking an optimal trajectory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for 2021 AIAA scitech GN&C conference</p></details> |

It is implemented by properly modifying the approximate solutions of the local Riemann problem in the HLL framework, resulting in two all-speed HLL-type schemes, namely ASHLLC and ASHLLEM solvers. Results from both numerical analysis and experiments demonstrate that the newly proposed schemes not only preserve desirable properties of their original versions, but are also able to provide accurate and robust solutions for complex flows ranging from low-Mach number incompressible to hypersonic compressible regimes. Thus, both the ASHLLC and ASHLLEM schemes can be used as reliable methods for hypersonic heating computations.</p></details> |  |
