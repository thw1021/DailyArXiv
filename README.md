| **[An Integrated Open Source Software System for the Generation and Analysis of Subject-Specific Blood Flow Simulation Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09392v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objective: Hemodynamic analysis of blood flow through arteries and veins is critical for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, such as aneurysms and stenoses, and for investigating cardiovascular parameters, such as turbulence and wall shear stress. For subject-specific analyses, the anatomy and blood flow of the subject can be captured non-invasively using structural and 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on the other hand, can be used to generate blood flow simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. To generate and analyze subject-specific blood flow simulations, MRI and CFD have to be brought together. Methods: We present an interactive, customizable, and user-oriented visual analysis tool that assists researchers in both medicine and numerical analysis. Our open-source tool is applicable to domains such as CFD and MRI, and it facilitates the analysis of simulation results and medical data, especially in hemodynamic studies. It enables the creation of simulation ensembles with a high variety of parameters. Furthermore, it allows for the visual and analytical examination of simulations and measurements through 2D embeddings of the similarity space. Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we applied it to three real-world use cases, showcasing its ability to configure simulation ensembles and analyse blood flow dynamics. We evaluated our example cases together with MRI and CFD experts to further enhance features and increase the usability. Conclusions: By combining the strengths of both CFD and MRI, our tool provides a more comprehensive understanding of hemodynamic parameters, facilitating more accurate analysis of hemodynamic biomarkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with deformable interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Physics Reasoning and Performance Taxonomy in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08270v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics, remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over 400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Train Operator Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08071v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a tensor--train framework for nonintrusive operator inference aimed at learning discrete operators and using them to predict solutions of physical governing equations. Our framework comprises three approaches: full--order tensor--train operator inference, full--order quantized tensor--train operator inference, and reduced--order tensor--train operator inference. In each case, snapshot data is represented in tensor--train format--either through compression or cross interpolation--enabling the efficient handling of extremely large datasets with significantly reduced computational effort compared to standard methods. The effectiveness of each approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments related to Computational Fluid Dynamics and benchmarked against the standard reduced--order operator inference method, highlighting the advantages of the tensor--train representations in both accuracy and scalability.</p></details> | AIAA SciTech 2026 |
| **[Mixed-precision numerics in scientific applications: survey and perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19322v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads has led to a significant increase in silicon area dedicated to lower-precision computations on recent high-performance computing hardware designs. However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this survey, we (1) review progress across diverse scientific domains -- including fluid dynamics, weather and climate, quantum chemistry, and computational genomics -- that have begun adopting mixed-precision strategies; (2) examine state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques such as iterative refinement, splitting and emulation schemes, and adaptive precision solvers; (3) assess their implications for accuracy, performance, and resource utilization; and (4) survey the emerging software ecosystem that enables mixed-precision methods at scale. We conclude with perspectives and recommendations on cross-cutting opportunities, domain-specific challenges, and the role of co-design between application scientists, numerical analysts and computer scientists. Collectively, this survey underscores that mixed-precision numerics can reshape computational science by aligning algorithms with the evolving landscape of hardware capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of Supercomputing</p></details> |
| **[ChatCFD: An LLM-Driven Agent for End-to-End CFD Automation with Domain-Specific Structured Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02019v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for advancing scientific and engineering fields but is hindered by operational complexity, high expertise requirements, and limited accessibility. This paper introduces ChatCFD, an automated agent system for OpenFOAM simulations that processes multi-modal inputs (e.g., research papers, meshes) via an interactive interface, leveraging DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 large language models, a multi-agent architecture, and OpenFOAM knowledge. Its four-stage pipeline (Knowledge Base Construction, User Input Processing, Case File Generation, and Execution and Error Reflection) enables iterative trial-reflection-refinement for intricate setups, supporting diverse physical models and external meshes. Validation on 205 benchmark tutorial cases, 110 perturbed variants, and 2 literature-derived cases shows ChatCFD's 82.1 percent operational success rate on basic cases, outperforming MetaOpenFOAM (6.2 percent) and Foam-Agent (42.3 percent), and 60-80 percent on literature-derived complex cases. Turbulence model studies show a 40 percent success rate for common models versus 10 percent for rare ones like RNG k-epsilon. Physics coupling analyses reveal higher resource demands for multi-physics-coupled cases, while LLM bias toward simpler setups introduces persistent errors, such as dimensional inconsistency. Ablation studies highlight the efficacy of RAG-based modules and reflection mechanisms. By automating hypothesis testing and parameter exploration, ChatCFD accelerates scientific discovery in fluid mechanics and engineering, addressing LLM limitations through structured design and showing strong potential as a modular component in MCP-based agent networks for collaborative multi-agent systems, paving the way for scalable AI-driven CFD innovation. The code for ChatCFD is available at https://github.com/ConMoo/ChatCFD.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A novel biomass fluidized bed gasification model coupled with machine learning and CFD simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06056v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A coupling model of biomass fluidized bed gasification based on machine learning and computational fluid dynamics is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of complex thermochemical reaction process. By constructing a high-quality data set based on experimental data and high fidelity simulation results, the agent model used to describe the characteristics of reaction kinetics was trained and embedded into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework to realize the real-time update of reaction rate and composition evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Stage Graph Neural Networks for Data-Driven Prediction of Natural Convection in Enclosed Cavities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06041v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPINN: An Optimal Self-Supervised Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05886v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks. Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Transfer Dynamics Generated by Non-Axisymmetric Tornado-Type Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05546v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy cascade in turbulence, first statistically described by Richardson (1922) and Kolmogorov (1941), lacked connection to the underlying fluid dynamics. Recent numerical studies of Goto et al. (2017) and Yoneda et al. (2022) revealed scale-local energy transfer via vortex stretching but remained within spatial statistics. This study aims to uncover the time-dependent elementary process behind the energy cascade by constructing a tornado-type flow in a non-axisymmetric curved cylindrical domain. Our approach reveals specific vortex dynamics responsible for energy transfer, offering new insight into the physical mechanisms of turbulence.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Entropy stable finite difference methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity and knapsack limiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.14488</p></details> |
| **[A novel approach to study the wellposedness of the 3D fluid-2D plate interaction PDE System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03431v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a certain fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system with a view of obtaining an alternative methodology for establishing its strongly continuous semigroup wellposedness. (Semigroup generation for this FSI was originally considered in Avalos-Clark (2014).) The FSI model under consideration describes the vibrations of an incompressible fluid within a 3D cavity as it interacts with the elastic membrane on the ``free" upper boundary of the cavity. Such coupled PDE systems appear in variety of natural settings such as biomedicine, aeroelasticity, and fluid dynamics. Our proof of $C_0$-semigroup wellposedness is based on a proper application of Lumer Phillips Theorem. In this regard, our main challenge is to show the maximality of the corresponding semigroup generator. To this end, we develop a ``nonstandard" inf-sup approach which avoids the use of technical nonlocal maps in the associated bilinear forms--unlike the earlier paper Avalos-Clark (2014)--and allows for the solution of the fluid and plate solution variables simultanously. Our new inf-sup strategy will lead to a more efficient mixed finite element method (FEM) for approximating solutions to the FSI problem, inasmuch our novel variational formulation avoids bilinear forms which are free from the computationally-intensive nonlocal solution operators invoked in Avalos-Clark (2014). We also perform numerical tests based on this formulation using a benchmark problem and present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Computational Fluid Dynamics Optimization of F1 Front Wing using Physics Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01963v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results, require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24 hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12 aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination (R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of design space within regulatory constraints.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Towards Digital Twins for Optimal Radioembolization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02607v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability. To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support. Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluate Neighbor Search for Curve-based Vector Field Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00180v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space, popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap, this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings that were overlooked by the community.</p></details> | 12 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Active Learning for Deep Learning-Based Hemodynamic Parameter Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03453v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hemodynamic parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress play an important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in cardiovascular diseases. These parameters can be accurately computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive. Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained. These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to difficult cases. Our results show that active learning is a feasible strategy to increase the potential of deep learning-based CFD surrogates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep vectorised operators for pulsatile hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries from a steady-state prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11920v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in silico. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation-independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure (approximation disparity 0.368 $\pm$ 0.079) while being agnostic ($p < 0.05$ in a one-way ANOVA test) to re-sampling of the source domain, i.e. discretisation-independent. This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine"</p></details> |
| **[Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Discovery and Formulation Refines the Quasi-Steady Model of Flapping-Wing Aerodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18703v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology, physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs: high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models, we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Improving Long-term Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Predictions: A Proof of Concept with Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18565v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost. Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Transformers for Mesh-Based Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18051v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

| **[Beyond Blur: A Fluid Perspective on Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16827v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 main conference, 8 pages paper, 20 pages appendix, 24 figures, supplementary pseudocode in appendix, https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/1176</p></details> |
| **[The compressible Neural Particle Method for Simulating Compressible Viscous Fluid Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16916v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking. However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks. The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step, and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility. The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PASJ</p></details> |
| **[OpenLB-UQ: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Incompressible Fluid Flow Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13867v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in computational fluid dynamics to assess the reliability and robustness of simulations, given the uncertainties in input parameters. OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fluid Dynamics and Domain Reconstruction from Noisy Flow Images Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Quasi-Conformal Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11216v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

These Interactive AI systems adapt to users over time, build ongoing relationships, and even can take proactive actions on behalf of users. This new paradigm requires us to rethink how such human-AI interactions can be studied effectively to inform governance and policy development. In this paper, we draw on insights from a collaborative interdisciplinary workshop with policymakers, behavioral scientists, Human-Computer Interaction researchers, and civil society practitioners, to identify challenges and methodological opportunities arising within new forms of human-AI interactions. Based on these insights, we discuss an outcome-focused regulatory approach that integrates behavioral insights to address both the risks and benefits of emerging human-AI relationships. In particular, we emphasize the need for new methods to study the fluid, dynamic, and context-dependent nature of these interactions. We provide practical recommendations for developing human-centric AI governance, informed by behavioral insights, that can respond to the complexities of Interactive AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of AAAI/ACM Conference AIES 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniFluids: Physics Pre-trained Modeling of Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10862v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) drives progress in numerous scientific and engineering fields, yet high-fidelity simulations remain computationally prohibitive. While machine learning approaches offer computing acceleration, they typically specialize in single physical systems or require extensive training data, hindering their applicability in highly nonlinear and 3D flow scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniFluids, a pure physics pre-trained model that captures fundamental fluid dynamics laws and adapts efficiently to diverse downstream tasks with minimal data. We develop a training framework combining physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. This enables OmniFluids to retain broad physics knowledge while delivering fast and accurate predictions. Architecturally, OmniFluids integrates a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, seamlessly incorporating physics-based supervision while allowing efficient and scalable modeling of diverse tasks. Extensive tests on a broad range of 2D and 3D benchmarks show that OmniFluids outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in terms of flow field prediction and turbulence statistics. It delivers 10--100$\times$ speedups over traditional solvers while maintaining a comparable accuracy and accurately identifies unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work demonstrates the potential of training a unified CFD solver exclusively from physics knowledge, offering a new approach for efficient and generalizable modeling across complex fluid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffeomorphic Neural Operator Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06690v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an operator learning approach for a class of evolution operators using a composition of a learned lift into the space of diffeomorphisms of the domain and the group action on the field space. In turn, this transforms the semigroup structure of the evolution operator into a corresponding group structure allowing time stepping be performed through composition on the space of diffeomorphisms rather than in the field space directly. This results in a number of structure-preserving properties related to preserving a relabelling symmetry of the dynamics as a hard constraint. We study the resolution properties of our approach, along with its connection to the techniques of diffeomorphic image registration. Numerical experiments on forecasting turbulent fluid dynamics are provided, demonstrating its conservative properties, non-diffusivity, and ability to capture anticipated statistical scaling relations at sub-grid scales. Our method provides an example of geometric operator learning and indicates a clear performance benefit from leveraging a priori known infinite-dimensional geometric structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance measurements of modern Fortran MPI applications with Score-P](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16592v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Version 3.0 of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard, released in 2012, introduced a new set of language bindings for Fortran 2008. By making use of modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was finally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran. This highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely adopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support for the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to recede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08 bindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by implementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard version 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By implementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for MPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The implementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08 wrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a spectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this work, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the implementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key component of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately 50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python pympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from the MPI standard.</p></details> |  |

Numerical and parallel scalability of these methods can be achieved by adding coarse levels. A successful coarse space, inspired by iterative substructuring, is the generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) space. In https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1184047, based on the GDSW approach, two-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for saddle point problems were introduced. We present parallel results up to 32768 MPI ranks for the solution of incompressible fluid problems for a Poiseuille flow example on the unit cube and a complex extrusion die geometry using a two- and a three-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. These results are achieved through the combination of the additive overlapping Schwarz solvers implemented in the Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56750-7_19, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.64, and the FEATFLOW library http://www.featflow.de using a scalable interface for the efficient coupling of the two libraries.

| **[Optimal Linear Baseline Models for Scientific Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05831v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging, financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific machine learning problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 10 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; name changed, added references, polished language, expanded appendix</p></details> |
| **[Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |

Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Order Participation Factor Computation via Batch-Structured Tensor Contraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08968v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

We define the problem of sensitivity-based parametric uncertainty quantification in dynamical system estimation. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel robustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with and without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics, and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on the robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting estimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and paves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward sensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication in the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |

Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</p></details> |  |

Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 1 figure |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models for fluid-porous systems: derivation, analysis and validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16577v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow interaction between a plain-fluid region in contact with a porous layer attracted significant attention from modelling and analysis sides due to numerous applications in biology, environment and industry. In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, Published in Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2025, DOI:/10.1016/j.amc.2025.129687</p></details> |
| **[Power-Series Approach to Moment-Matching-Based Model Reduction of MIMO Polynomial Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13595v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The model reduction problem for high-order multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) polynomial nonlinear systems based on moment matching is addressed. The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |

These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Global Model Reduction Learning in Porous Media Flow Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09335v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we combine deep learning concepts and some proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model reduction methods for predicting flow in heterogeneous porous media. Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

This paper presents a computationally efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%, and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains, including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2025</p></details> |
| **[Taming High-Dimensional Dynamics: Learning Optimal Projections onto Spectral Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03157v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional nonlinear systems pose considerable challenges for modeling and control across many domains, from fluid mechanics to advanced robotics. Such systems are typically approximated with reduced-order models, which often rely on orthogonal projections, a simplification that may lead to large prediction errors. In this work, we derive optimality of fiber-aligned projections onto spectral submanifolds, preserving the nonlinear geometric structure and minimizing long-term prediction error. We propose a data-driven procedure to learn these projections from trajectories and demonstrate its effectiveness through a 180-dimensional robotic system. Our reduced-order models achieve up to fivefold improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoencoder-based non-intrusive model order reduction in continuum mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02237v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters. To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive. These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v4)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00294v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Deep-Learning Enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Method for Conjugate Heat Transfer Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20633v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current study aims to develop a non-intrusive Reduced Order Model (ROM) to reconstruct the full temperature field for a large-scale industrial application based on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</p></details> |  |

Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally, moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

A core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii) specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple, task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required to design DTs. In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models. It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |

The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |

The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11542v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient data-driven regression for reduced-order modeling of spatial pattern formation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06833v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an efficient data-driven regression approach for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) of reaction-diffusion systems exhibiting pattern formation. The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Collocation Point Strategies For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700v4)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose two adaptive collocation point selection strategies utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approaches improve PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</p></details> |  |

The approach begins with the introduction of innovative monolithic and global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithms, which incorporate the backward differentiation formulas for time discretization. In each iteration, these algorithms involve solving a diffusion subproblem over the entire temporal domain, followed by solving a generalized Stokes subproblem over the same time interval. To accelerate the global-in-time iterative process, we present a reduced order modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition, aimed at reducing the primary computational cost from the generalized Stokes subproblem. The effectiveness of this novel method is validated both theoretically and through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Using push-forward maps and Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow, we reformulate the TDSE as a Hamiltonian system in terms of push-forward maps. The new formulation can be viewed as a generative model in the Wasserstein space, which is a manifold of probability density functions. Then we parameterize the push-forward maps by reduce-order models such as neural networks. This induces a new metric in the parameter space by pulling back the Wasserstein metric on density manifold, which further results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters of the reduce-order model. Leveraging the computational techniques from deep learning, such as Neural ODE, we design an algorithm to solve the TDSE in the parameterized push-forward map space, which provides an alternative approach with the potential to scale up to high-dimensional problems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.</p></details> |  |

The method integrates a novel algorithm with Pareto front analysis to construct a compact, high-fidelity reduced-order model that balances accuracy and efficiency. An explainable NLARX deep learning framework enables real-time, adaptive calibration and prediction, while a key innovation-computing orthogonal Koopman modes via randomized orthogonal projections-ensures optimal data representation. This approach for data-driven twin modeling is fully self-consistent, avoiding heuristic choices and enhancing interpretability through integrated explainable learning techniques. The proposed method is demonstrated on shock wave phenomena using three experiments of increasing complexity, accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the resulting data-driven twin models.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |

The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</p></details> |  |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Continuous- and Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18131v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse scattering for Schrödinger equation in the frequency domain via data-driven reduced order modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11034v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we develop a numerical method for solving an inverse scattering problem of estimating the scattering potential in a Schr\"{o}dinger equation from frequency domain measurements based on reduced order models (ROM). The ROM is a projection of Schr\"{o}dinger operator onto a subspace spanned by its solution snapshots at certain wavenumbers. Provided the measurements are performed at these wavenumbers, the ROM can be constructed in a data-driven manner from the measurements on a surface surrounding the scatterers. Once the ROM is computed, the scattering potential can be estimated using non-linear optimization that minimizes the ROM misfit. Such an approach typically outperforms the conventional methods based on data misfit minimization. We develop two variants of ROM-based algorithms for inverse scattering and test them on a synthetic example in two spatial dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers based on an ALE approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13613v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a Galerkin projection-based reduced-order modelling (ROM) approach for segregated fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, formulated within an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework at low Reynolds numbers using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is constructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and incorporates a data-driven technique that combines classical Galerkin projection with radial basis function (RBF) networks. The results demonstrate the numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed method relative to the high-fidelity model. The ROM successfully captures transient flow fields and, importantly, the forces acting on the moving structure without exhibiting unphysical growth or divergence over time. This is further supported by the bounded evolution of error metrics and physical observables, which remain consistent with the full-order simulations throughout the prediction horizon. The method's effectiveness is validated through a benchmark vortex-induced vibration (VIV) case involving a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=200. The hybrid ROM approach yields an accurate and efficient tool for solving FSI problems involving mesh motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow singular value decay. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method, but with a data-driven basis. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying the space-local POD, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions compared to standard POD, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method. Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D and 2D advection equation. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, source code can be found at https://github.com/tobyvg/local_POD_overlap.jl</p></details> |
| **[Blending data and physics for reduced-order modeling of systems with spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21299v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.</p></details> |  |

The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |

For stable reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems. The implementation is made available for reproducibility and further use.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

For both the continuous and the discrete (finite element) settings, we prove that the new strategy yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers that were not covered by current results. We also show that the new feedback control yields more accurate results than the current control approaches in marginally-resolved numerical simulations of a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=1000$. We note, however, that for realistic control parameters, the stabilizing effect of the new feedback control strategy is not sufficient in the convection-dominated regime. Our second contribution is the development of an adaptive evolve-filter-relax (aEFR) regularization that stabilizes marginally-resolved simulations in the convection-dominated regime and increases the accuracy of the new feedback control in realistic parameter settings. For the finite element setting, we prove that the novel feedback control equipped with the new aEFR method yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, our numerical investigation shows that the new strategy yields accurate results for reduced order models that dramatically decrease the size of the feedback control problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors. The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively. Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder QR. For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for highly ill-conditioned matrices. The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments on a laptop and computation server.</p></details> | Preprint |

The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

The evaluation of objective and constraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used to explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models are sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control problem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions requires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE). The models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the Boussinesq PDE.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 17 figures, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Large-Scale Linear Parameter Varying Systems with Dynamic Mode Decomposition Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02336v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems are a well-established class of nonlinear systems with a rich theory for stability analysis, control, and analytical response finding, among other aspects. Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 9 figures.

| **[An Adaptive Port Technique for Synthesising Rotational Components in Component Modal Synthesis Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03276v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Component Modal Synthesis (CMS) is a reduced order modelling method widely used for large-scale complex systems. It can effectively approximate system-level models through component synthesis, in which the repetitive geometrical components are modelled once and synthesised together. However, the conventional CMS only applies to systems with stationary components connected by strictly compatible ports, limiting it from modelling systems with moving components. This paper presents an adaptive port (AP) technique to extend CMS approaches for modelling parametric systems with rotational parts. To demonstrate the capability of the AP technique, we apply it to the Static Condensation Reduced Basis Element (SCRBE), one widely used variant of CMS approaches. The AP-based SCRBE (AP-SCRBE) can enforce the synthesis of rotational-stationary components over a shared adaptive port when the connecting surfaces of two components are discretisation-wise incompatible, which happens when one component moves relative to the others. Numerical experiments on the NREL 5MW wind turbine show that, in the context of rotational-stationary component synthesis, the AP-SCRBE can accurately and efficiently model the rotating rotor with pitch rotation of blades. It can produce almost identical results to a high-fidelity finite element model at two to three orders faster speeds.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Ensemble Kalman Filter for Data Assimilation coupled with low-resolution computations techniques applied in Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00539v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an innovative Reduced-Order Model (ROM) for merging experimental and simulation data using Data Assimilation (DA) to estimate the "True" state of a fluid dynamics system, leading to more accurate predictions. Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.</p></details> | <details><summary>artic...</summary><p>article, 49 pages, 29 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[High order global flux schemes for general steady state preservation of shallow water moment equations with non-conservative products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00573v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow water moment equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that allow to represent vertical variations of the velocity profile at the expense of additional evolution equations for a number of additional variables, so called moments. This introduces non-linear non-conservative products in the system, which make the analytical characterization of steady states much harder if not impossible. The lack of analytical steady states poses a challenge for the design of well-balanced schemes, which aim at preserving such steady states as crucial in many applications. In this work, we present a family of fully well-balanced, high-order WENO finite volume methods for general hyperbolic balance laws with non-conservative products like the shallow water moment equations, for which no analytical steady states are available. The schemes are based on the flux globalization approach, in which both source terms and non-conservative products are integrated with a tailored high order quadrature in the divergence term. The resulting global flux is then reconstructed instead of the conservative variables to preserve all steady states. Numerical tests show the optimal convergence of the method and a significant error reduction for steady state solutions. Furthermore, we provide a numerical comparison of perturbed steady states for different families of shallow water moment equations, which illustrates the flexibility of our method that is valid for general equations without prior knowledge of steady states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Physics-Based Li-ion Battery Model via Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Learning and Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00353v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |

The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems. Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact operator inference with minimal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01244v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel method to generate snapshot data for operator inference that guarantees the exact reconstruction of intrusive projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs). To ensure exact reconstruction, the operator inference least squares matrix must have full rank, without regularization. Existing works have achieved this full rank using heuristic strategies to generate snapshot data and a-posteriori checks on full rank, but without a guarantee of success. Our novel snapshot data generation method provides this guarantee thanks to two key ingredients: first we identify ROM states that induce full rank, then we generate snapshots corresponding to exactly these states by simulating multiple trajectories for only a single time step. This way, the number of required snapshots is minimal and orders of magnitude lower than typically reported with existing methods. The method avoids non-Markovian terms and does not require re-projection. Since the number of snapshots is minimal, the least squares problem simplifies to a linear system that is numerically more stable. In addition, because the inferred operators are exact, properties of the intrusive ROM operators such as symmetry or skew-symmetry are preserved. Numerical results for differential equations involving 2nd, 3rd and 8th order polynomials demonstrate that the novel snapshot data generation method leads to exact reconstruction of the intrusive reduced order models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

The framework accommodates precise probabilistic, imprecise probabilistic, and non-probabilistic representations, including the distribution-free probability-box (p-box). A central aspect of the framework involves transforming the original uncertainty inputs into an augmented random space, yielding the primary challenge of determining the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the response quantity of interest given epistemic uncertainty parameters. The recently proposed decoupled multi-probability density evolution method (decoupled M-PDEM) is employed to numerically solve the conditional PDF for complex dynamical systems. Several numerical examples illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed framework. These include a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system subject to Gaussian white noise with its natural frequency modeled as a p-box, a 10-DOF hysteretic structure subject to imprecise seismic loads, and a crash box model with mixed random and interval system parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint(initial draft) of a manuscript submitted to Reliability Engineering & System Safety journal</p></details> |

We recently proposed the Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems (NCDS), which is a neural network architecture that guarantees contractive stability. With this, learning-from-demonstrations approaches can trivially provide stability guarantees. However, our early work left several unanswered questions, which we here address. Beyond providing an in-depth explanation of NCDS, this paper extends the framework with more careful regularization, a conditional variant of the framework for handling multiple tasks, and an uncertainty-driven approach to latent obstacle avoidance. Experiments verify that the developed system has the flexibility of ordinary neural networks while providing the stability guarantees needed for autonomous robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.09352</p></details> |

The system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach, including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation Strategies for Nonlinear Feedback Control Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07439v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the stabilization of dynamical systems in the infinite horizon optimal control setting using nonlinear feedback control based on State-Dependent Riccati Equations (SDREs). While effective, the practical implementation of such feedback strategies is often constrained by the high dimensionality of state spaces and the computational challenges associated with solving SDREs, particularly in parametric scenarios. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) methodology, which provides an efficient and accurate framework for addressing high-dimensional feedback control problems. DLRA dynamically constructs a compact, low-dimensional representation that evolves with the problem, enabling the simultaneous resolution of multiple parametric instances in real-time. We propose two novel algorithms to enhance numerical performances: the cascade-Newton-Kleinman method and Riccati-based DLRA (R-DLRA). The cascade-Newton-Kleinman method accelerates convergence by leveraging Riccati solutions from the nearby parameter or time instance, supported by a theoretical sensitivity analysis. R-DLRA integrates Riccati information into the DLRA basis construction to improve the quality of the solution. These approaches are validated through nonlinear one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases showing transport-like behavior, demonstrating that R-DLRA outperforms standard DLRA and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based model order reduction in both speed and accuracy, offering a superior alternative to Full Order Model solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning). 15 pages 11 figures</p></details> |

While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients. Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties. As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Numerical modeling of elastic waves in thin shells with grid-characteristic method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09017v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical modeling of strength and non-destructive testing of complex structures such as buildings, space rockets or oil reservoirs often involves calculations on extremely large grids. The modeling of elastic wave processes in solids places limitations on the grid element size because resolving different elastic waves requires at least several grid elements for the characteristic size of the modeled object. For a thin plate, the defining size is its thickness, and a complex structure that contains large-scale thin objects requires a large-scale grid to preserve its uniformity. One way to bypass this problem is the theory of thin plates and shells that replaces a simple material model on a fine three-dimensional mesh with a more complex material model on a coarser mesh. This approach loses certain fine effects inside the thin plate, but allows us to model large and complex thin objects with a reasonable size calculation grid and resolve all the significant wave types. In this research, we take the Kirchhoff-Love material model and derive a hyperbolic dynamic system of equations that allows for a physical interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system is solved numerically with a grid-characteristic method. Numerical results for several model statements are compared with three-dimensional calculations based on grid-characteristic method for a three dimensional elasticity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teamwork as Linear Interpersonal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08811v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member's past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Turbulent Flows with Generative Models: Super-resolution, Forecasting, and Sparse Flow Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08752v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and computational fluid mechanics.

| **[HopCast: Calibration of Autoregressive Dynamics Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16587v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are often trained to approximate dynamical systems that can be modeled using differential equations. Many of these models are optimized to predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step predictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep Ensembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via autoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce calibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative Predictor-Corrector approach named \hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the dynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's output based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set of errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher predictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The calibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical systems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty propagation methods based on calibration errors.</p></details> |  |

We define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for presentation in IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), 2025</p></details> |

A novel method is proposed to explicitly construct the probability mass function associated with the quantized measurements by approximating the indicator function of each region defined by the quantizer using Gaussian mixture models. Unlike previous approaches, this technique generalizes to any number of quantized outputs without requiring case-specific numerical solutions, making it a scalable and efficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed filter achieves high accuracy in state estimation, both in terms of fidelity of the filtering distributions and mean squared error, while maintaining significantly reduced computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been acepted for presentation in the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control. 6 pages, 8 Figures</p></details> |
| **[State Estimation with Protecting Exogenous Inputs via Cramér-Rao Lower Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08756v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the real-time state estimation problem for dynamic systems while protecting exogenous inputs against adversaries, who may be honest-but-curious third parties or external eavesdroppers. The Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is employed to constrain the mean square error (MSE) of the adversary's estimate for the exogenous inputs above a specified threshold. By minimizing the MSE of the state estimate while ensuring a certain privacy level measured by CRLB, the problem is formulated as a constrained optimization. To solve the optimization problem, an explicit expression for CRLB is first provided. As the computational complexity of the CRLB increases with the time step, a low-complexity approach is proposed to make the complexity independent of time. Then, a relaxation approach is proposed to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally, a privacy-preserving state estimation algorithm with low complexity is developed, which also ensures $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. Two illustrative examples, including a practical scenario for protecting building occupancy, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Estimation of Lifetime Effects in A/B Testing via Treatment Locality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19618v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing randomized experiments to evaluate the effect of short-term treatments on the short-term outcomes has been well understood and become the golden standard in industrial practice. However, as service systems become increasingly dynamical and personalized, much focus is shifting toward maximizing long-term outcomes, such as customer lifetime value, through lifetime exposure to interventions. Our goal is to assess the impact of treatment and control policies on long-term outcomes from relatively short-term observations, such as those generated by A/B testing. A key managerial observation is that many practical treatments are local, affecting only targeted states while leaving other parts of the policy unchanged. This paper rigorously investigates whether and how such locality can be exploited to improve estimation of long-term effects in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a fundamental model of dynamic systems. We first develop optimal inference techniques for general A/B testing in MDPs and establish corresponding efficiency bounds. We then propose methods to harness the localized structure by sharing information on the non-targeted states. Our new estimator can achieve a linear reduction with the number of test arms for a major part of the variance without sacrificing unbiasedness. It also matches a tighter variance lower bound that accounts for locality. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a broad class of differentiable estimators, which encompasses many widely used approaches in practice. We show that all such estimators can benefit from variance reduction through information sharing without increasing their bias. Together, these results provide both theoretical foundations and practical tools for conducting efficient experiments in dynamic service systems with local treatments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransMPC: Transformer-based Explicit MPC with Variable Prediction Horizon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07381v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment. Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention, enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases. Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy, adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel statistical workflow for nonstationary modelling of successive Fréchet extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07296v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of the frequency and magnitude of successive extreme events in energy demand is critical for strategic resource planning. Traditional approaches based on extreme value theory (EVT) are typically limited to modelling isolated extreme events and struggle to capture the dynamics of temporally clustered extremes, such as those driven by prolonged extreme weather events. These limitations are exacerbated by the scarcity of historical data and computational costs of longrun simulations leading to high uncertainty in return level estimates for successive extremes. Here, we introduce a novel statistical framework leveraging recent theoretical advances in successive extreme value modelling in dynamical systems. Under reasonable assumptions of the time series data (e.g. the data follow a fat-tailed Fr\'{e}chet distribution), our tool allows for significantly more robust estimates of returns and magnitudes of successive extreme events compared to standard likelihood methods. We illustrate our statistical workflow on scenarios of forecasted gas supply levels from 2025 to 2050. Common measures of statistical accuracy are provided as benchmarks for comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Neural Koopman Operators with Dissipativity Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07294v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of learning a neural Koopman operator model that provides dissipativity guarantees for an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. We propose a two-stage approach. First, we learn an unconstrained neural Koopman model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Then, we minimally perturb the parameters to enforce strict dissipativity. Crucially, we establish theoretical guarantees that extend the dissipativity properties of the learned model back to the original nonlinear system. We realize this by deriving an exact relationship between the dissipativity of the learned model and the true system through careful characterization of the identification errors from the noisy data, Koopman operator truncation, and generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate our approach through simulation on a Duffing oscillator model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum algorithms for general nonlinear dynamics based on the Carleman embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07155v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Important nonlinear dynamics, such as those found in plasma and fluid systems, are typically hard to simulate on classical computers. Thus, if fault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear problems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent breakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single condition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation. This result, however, is limited to the class of purely dissipative systems with negative log-norm, which excludes application to many important problems. In this work, we correct technical issues with this and other prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical systems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of ways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems to a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic Lyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent $R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we extend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where conserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results for the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that efficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems than previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator problems of exponential size. In our analysis, we also obtain several results related to the Poincar\'{e}-Dulac theorem and diagonalization of the Carleman matrix, which could be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>70+78...</summary><p>70+78 pages, 4 figures.

Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

To this end, existing chemical implementations of neural computing have mainly relied on emulating discrete-layered neural architectures using steady-state computations of mass action kinetics. In contrast, we propose an alternative dynamical systems-based approach in which neural computations are modeled as the time evolution of molecular concentrations. The analog nature of our framework naturally aligns with chemical kinetics-based computation, leading to more compact circuits. We present the advantages of our framework through three key demonstrations. First, we assemble an end-to-end supervised learning pipeline using only two sequential phases, the minimum required number for supervised learning. Then, we show (through appropriate simplifications) that both linear and nonlinear modeling circuits can be implemented solely using unimolecular and bimolecular reactions, avoiding the complexities of higher-order chemistries. Finally, we demonstrate that first-order gradient approximations can be natively incorporated into the framework, enabling nonlinear models to scale linearly rather than combinatorially with input dimensionality. All the circuit constructions are validated through training and inference simulations across various regression and classification tasks. Our work presents a viable pathway toward embedding learning behaviors in synthetic biochemical systems.</p></details> |  |

Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 28 figures Under review at Springer Nonlinear Dynamics</p></details> |

The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted to the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

The goal of this paper is to improve the convergence rate of the sample-wise backpropagation algorithm in neural stochastic differential equation model which has been proposed in [Archibald et al., SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 62 (2024), pp. 593-621]. It is necessary to emphasize that, improving the convergence order of the algorithm consisting of forward backward stochastic differential equations remains challenging, due to the loss of information of Z term in backward equations under sample-wise approximation and the limitations of the forward network form. In this paper, we develop a high-order backpropagation algorithm to improve the training accuracy. Under the convexity assumption, the result indicates that the first-order convergence is achieved when the number of training steps is proportional to the cubic number of layers. Finally, numerical examples illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Statistical Inference for Misspecified Contextual Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06287v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive experiments to balance bias and variance. Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals, and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in practice.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parameterize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated DC microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over a hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost is equal to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</p></details> |  |

It relies on online measurements and limited model information, namely, the input-output sensitivity. In practice, various issues including inaccurate modeling, lack of observation, or changing conditions can lead to sensitivity mismatches, causing closed-loop sub-optimality or even instability. To handle such uncertainties, we pursue robust feedback optimization, where we optimize the closed-loop performance against all possible sensitivities lying in specific uncertainty sets.

| **[Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868v5)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we develop an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator using dynamic programming and tools from convex analysis. Our approach does not rely on restrictive noise assumptions and employs a Bellman-like update instead of a Bayesian update. Our proposed estimator is computationally efficient, with only modest overhead compared to a standard Kalman filter. Simulations demonstrate that our estimator achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than the Kalman filter and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art estimators, while requiring significantly less computational power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a provably-generalizable framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield provably-safe solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a single environment. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, DiTree achieves on average a 30% higher success rate compared to standalone DP or SBPs, on a dynamic car and Mujoco's ant robot settings (for the latter, SBPs fail completely). Beyond simulation, real-world car experiments confirm DiTree's applicability, demonstrating superior trajectory quality and robustness even under severe sim-to-real gaps.

| **[Shift Before You Learn: Enabling Low-Rank Representations in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05193v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.</p></details> | 67 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Feedback Linearisation with State Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05191v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feedback Linearisation (FBL) is a widely used technique that applies feedback laws to transform input-affine nonlinear dynamical systems into linear dynamical systems, allowing for the use of linear controller design methods such as pole placement. However, for problems with state constraints, controlling the linear system induced by FBL can be more challenging than controlling the original system. This is because simple state constraints in the original nonlinear system become complex nonlinear constraints in the FBL induced linearised system, thereby diminishing the advantages of linearisation. To avoid increasing the complexity of state constraints under FBL, this paper introduces a method to first augment system dynamics to capture state constraints before applying FBL. We show that our proposed augmentation method leads to ill-defined relative degrees at state constraint boundaries. However, we show that ill-defined relative degrees can be overcome by using a switching FBL controller. Numerical experiments illustrate the capabilities of this method for handling state constraints within the FBL framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

In this setting, existing algorithms either yield biased parameter estimates or have large sample complexities. We resolve these issues by adapting the instrumental variable method and the bias compensation method, originally proposed for error-in-variables models, to our setting. We provide refined non-asymptotic analysis for both methods. Under mild conditions, our algorithms achieve superior sample complexities that match the best-known sample complexity for learning a fully observable system without observation noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echoes Before Collapse: Deep Learning Detection of Flickering in Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04683v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a wide range of dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC: Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04619v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven machine learning methodologies have attracted considerable attention for the control and estimation of dynamical systems. However, such implementations suffer from a lack of predictability and robustness. Thus, adoption of data-driven tools has been minimal for safety-aware applications despite their impressive empirical results. While classical tools like robust adaptive control can ensure predictable performance, their consolidation with data-driven methods remains a challenge and, when attempted, leads to conservative results. The difficulty of consolidation stems from the inherently different `spaces' that robust control and data-driven methods occupy. Data-driven methods suffer from the distribution-shift problem, which current robust adaptive controllers can only tackle if using over-simplified learning models and unverifiable assumptions. In this paper, we present $\mathcal{L}_1$ distributionally robust adaptive control ($\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC): a control methodology for uncertain stochastic processes that guarantees robustness certificates in terms of uniform (finite-time) and maximal distributional deviation. We leverage the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control methodology to ensure the existence of Wasserstein ambiguity set around a nominal distribution, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution. The uniform ambiguity set produces an ambiguity tube of distributions centered on the nominal temporally-varying nominal distribution. The designed controller generates the ambiguity tube in response to both epistemic (model uncertainties) and aleatoric (inherent randomness and disturbances) uncertainties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distance Between Stochastic Linear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04014v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript proposes a distance measure between stochastic linear dynamical systems. While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two linear time invariant stochastic dynamical systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. Distance measure for stochastic systems is proposed for the frequency domain setting as the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-$q$ Wasserstein distance between the push-forward measures under both systems' corresponding measurable maps from the parameter space to their respective space of system plants. It is proved and demonstrated using numerical simulation that the proposed frequency domain distance measure shall never exceed the proposed time domain distance measure counterpart. Lower and upper bounds are provided for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings. The proposed distance measures induce a topology in the corresponding (frequency/time) domain space of stochastic dynamical systems and will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization. 27 Pages in total</p></details> |

With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative model and test on simple problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Efficient Certification of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03899v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However, computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted for publication in proceedings of IEEE CDC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reservoir Predictive Path Integral Control for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03839v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems. However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) -- reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication, 13 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a homomorphic encryption scheme for dynamic controllers that automatically discloses the residue signal for anomaly detection, while keeping all other signals private. To this end, we characterize the zero-dynamics of an encrypted dynamic system over a finite field of integers and incorporate it into a Learning With Errors (LWE) based scheme. We then present a method to further utilize the disclosed residue signal for implementing dynamic controllers over encrypted data, which does not involve re-encryption even when they have non-integer state matrices.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Considering the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures including appendices</p></details> |
