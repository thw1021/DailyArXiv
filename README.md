| **[Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment. This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale. On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence. This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Uncertainty via Automation: Observing, Analyzing, and Optimizing Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11277v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems - collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges. This paper presents our vision of AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles - developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users - each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems - not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Green Distributed AI Training: Orchestrating Compute Across Renewable-Powered Micro Datacenters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16182v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accelerating expansion of AI workloads is colliding with an energy landscape increasingly dominated by intermittent renewable generation. While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration. At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies. Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a paper submitted - v01 November 2025</p></details> |
| **[SPHaptics: A Real-Time Bidirectional Haptic Interaction Framework for Coupled Rigid-Soft Body and Lagrangian Fluid Simulation in Virtual Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15908v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Haptic feedback enhances immersion in virtual environments by allowing users to physically interact with simulated objects. Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (FRIS) Enabling Secure Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15860v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).</p></details> |  |
| **[Walrus: A Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Continuum Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15684v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have transformed machine learning for language and vision, but achieving comparable impact in physical simulation remains a challenge. Data heterogeneity and unstable long-term dynamics inhibit learning from sufficiently diverse dynamics, while varying resolutions and dimensionalities challenge efficient training on modern hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we incorporate new approaches to mitigate these obstacles, including a harmonic-analysis-based stabilization method, load-balanced distributed 2D and 3D training strategies, and compute-adaptive tokenization. Using these tools, we develop Walrus, a transformer-based foundation model developed primarily for fluid-like continuum dynamics. Walrus is pretrained on nineteen diverse scenarios spanning astrophysics, geoscience, rheology, plasma physics, acoustics, and classical fluids. Experiments show that Walrus outperforms prior foundation models on both short and long term prediction horizons on downstream tasks and across the breadth of pretraining data, while ablation studies confirm the value of our contributions to forecast stability, training throughput, and transfer performance over conventional approaches. Code and weights are released for community use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turb-L1: Achieving Long-term Turbulence Tracing By Tackling Spectral Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19038v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications. However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator learning for energy-efficient building ventilation control with computational fluid dynamics simulation of a real-world classroom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21243v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |
| **[FoilDiff: A Hybrid Transformer Backbone for Diffusion-based Modelling of 2D Airfoil Flow Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04325v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Graph Rewiring to Mitigate Over-Squashing in Mesh-Based GNNs for Fluid Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12709v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[JAX-LaB: A High-Performance, Differentiable, Lattice Boltzmann Library for Modeling Multiphase Fluid Dynamics in Geosciences and Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17713v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce JAX-LaB, a differentiable, Python-based Lattice Boltzmann simulation library designed for modeling multiphase and multiphysics fluid dynamics problems in hydrologic, geologic, and engineered porous media settings. The library is designed as an extension to XLB, and it is built on the JAX framework. The library delivers a performant, hardware-agnostic implementation that seamlessly integrates with machine learning libraries and scales efficiently across CPUs, multi-GPU setups, and distributed environments. Multiphase interactions are modeled using the Shan-Chen pseudopotential method, coupled with an equation of state (EOS) to reproduce densities consistent with Maxwell's construction, enabling accurate simulation of flows with density ratios $> 10^7$ while maintaining low spurious currents. Fluid wetting is achieved using the "improved" virtual density scheme, which enables precise control of contact angle on flat and curved surfaces, while eliminating non-physical films seen in the Shan-Chen virtual density scheme. This scheme integrates directly into the interaction force calculations, removing the need to handle fluid-fluid and fluid-solid forces separately. We validate the library's accuracy and performance through comprehensive analytical benchmarks, including Laplace's law, capillary rise in parallel plates, and multi-component cocurrent flow in a channel. We then use the code for several applications involving multicomponent and multiphase flows, including permeability estimation, injection of supercritical $CO_2$ in a water-saturated Fontainebleau sandstone, and obtaining the characteristic curves for a sphere pack geometry. Finally, the single-GPU performance and multi-GPU scaling of the code are evaluated on both single-node and distributed systems. The library is open-source under the Apache license and available at https://github.com/piyush-ppradhan/JAX-LaB.</p></details> | 34 pages, 17 figures |
| **[PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11048v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026.

| **[SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10833v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Knowledge-Guided Video Diffusion for Scientific Phenomena Generation from a Single Initial Frame](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11343v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in natural scene generation, yet they struggle to generalize to scientific phenomena such as fluid simulations and meteorological processes, where underlying dynamics are governed by scientific laws. These tasks pose unique challenges, including severe domain gaps, limited training data, and the lack of descriptive language annotations. To handle this dilemma, we extracted the latent scientific phenomena knowledge and further proposed a fresh framework that teaches video diffusion models to generate scientific phenomena from a single initial frame. Particularly, static knowledge is extracted via pre-trained masked autoencoders, while dynamic knowledge is derived from pre-trained optical flow prediction. Subsequently, based on the aligned spatial relations between the CLIP vision and language encoders, the visual embeddings of scientific phenomena, guided by latent scientific phenomena knowledge, are projected to generate the pseudo-language prompt embeddings in both spatial and frequency domains. By incorporating these prompts and fine-tuning the video diffusion model, we enable the generation of videos that better adhere to scientific laws. Extensive experiments on both computational fluid dynamics simulations and real-world typhoon observations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior fidelity and consistency across diverse scientific scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[KoopMotion: Learning Almost Divergence Free Koopman Flow Fields for Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09074v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

| **[Beyond Task-Oriented and Chitchat Dialogues: Proactive and Transition-Aware Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08835v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to EMNLP2025</p></details> |

In particular, these simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a finite element solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid-scale (SGS) closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We first demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, using it as a proof of concept to show that solver-consistent training produces stable and physically meaningful closures. Then, we extend this to a turbulent flow over a three-dimensional backward-facing step. In this setting, the GNN-based closure not only attains low prediction errors, but also recovers key turbulence statistics and preserves multiscale turbulent structures. We further demonstrate that the closure can be identified in data-limited learning scenarios as well. Overall, the proposed end-to-end learning paradigm offers a viable pathway toward physically consistent and generalizable data-driven SGS modeling on complex and unstructured domains.</p></details> |  |

The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems. The result is a decision support tool that not only produces an optimal trajectory but also provides the necessary insights for its execution, thereby contributing to greater effectiveness and safety in the employment of autonomous ground systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Nemotron Elastic: Towards Efficient Many-in-One Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16664v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.</p></details> |  |

To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

This result is shown through a new technique, called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems. Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides the following contributions. 1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to obtain the following two hardness results. 2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal $b$-matching problem requires $Ω(\min\{\log_{1+b}Δ, \log_Δn\})$ and $Ω(\sqrt{\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild. 3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors the edges of a graph with $Δ+ k$ colors requires $Ω(\min\{\log Δ, \log_Δn\})$ and $Ω(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\le Δ^{1-\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\varepsilon > 0$.</p></details> | 21 pages, no figures |
| **[Progressive Supernet Training for Efficient Visual Autoregressive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16546v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment. We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model. However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025. 10 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[The Oracle and The Prism: A Decoupled and Efficient Framework for Generative Recommendation Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16543v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |
| **[Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16468v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations are available at https://github.com/cmd2001/KVTuner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML25.

While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\textit{\underline{S}upport-\underline{E}ffective \underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures. Our findings highlight the potential of SEG to transform 3D printing by directly optimizing models during the generative process, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient digital fabrication practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (7 pages)</p></details> |
| **[AutoJudge: Judge Decoding Without Manual Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20039v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoJudge, a method that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the response, relaxing the distribution match guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft models should be corrected to preserve quality and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of AutoJudge with multiple draft/target model pairs on mathematical reasoning and programming benchmarks, achieving significant speedups at the cost of a minor accuracy reduction. Notably, on GSM8k with the Llama 3.1 70B target model, our approach achieves up to $\approx2\times$ speedup over speculative decoding at the cost of $\le 1\%$ drop in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, AutoJudge automatically detects programming-specific important tokens, accepting $\ge 25$ tokens per speculation cycle at $2\%$ drop in Pass@1. Our approach requires no human annotation and is easy to integrate with modern LLM inference frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning-Enhanced Observer for Linear Time-Invariant Systems with Parametric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16318v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

| **[VisPlay: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15661v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

Through a flurry of research since late 2022, steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation is exhibited. Since late 2022, a flurry of research has demonstrated steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation. While promising, evaluations show only incremental progress in real-world deployments, and the field still lacks a cohesive understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper provides the first comprehensive overview and analysis of this new domain. We survey and systematize the field by focusing on three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on LLM-powered honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends; and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Syste...</summary><p>Systemization of Knowledge</p></details> |

Liquid biopsies enable non-invasive monitoring of circulating biomarkers, but typical machine learning pipelines for high-dimensional tabular data (e.g., random forests, SVMs) rely on expensive hyperparameter tuning and can be brittle under class imbalance. We leverage a meta-trained Hyperfast model for classifying cancer, accomplishing the highest AUC of 0.9929 and simultaneously achieving robustness especially on highly imbalanced datasets compared to other ML algorithms in several binary classification tasks (e.g. breast invasive carcinoma; BRCA vs. non-BRCA). We also propose a novel ensemble model combining pre-trained Hyperfast model, XGBoost, and LightGBM for multi-class classification tasks, achieving an incremental increase in accuracy (0.9464) while merely using 500 PCA features; distinguishable from previous studies where they used more than 2,000 features for similar results. Crucially, we demonstrate robustness under class imbalance: empirically via balanced accuracy and minority-class recall across cancer-vs.-noncancer and cancer-vs.-rest settings, and theoretically by showing (i) a prototype-form final layer for Hyperfast that yields prior-insensitive decisions under bounded bias, and (ii) minority-error reductions for majority vote under mild error diversity. Together, these results indicate that pre-trained tabular models and simple ensembling can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy and improved minority-class performance with far fewer features and no additional tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AIAA Workshop at IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments. The open-source code, checkpoints for PPCL can be found at the following link: https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/Qwen-Image-Pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/Qwen-Image-Pruning</p></details> |

We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM, enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.</p></details> |  |

The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).</p></details> |  |
| **[Degradation-Aware Hierarchical Termination for Blind Quality Enhancement of Compressed Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16137v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

| **[CaberNet: Causal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain HVAC Energy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06634v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker. Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpectralTrain: A Universal Framework for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16084v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

| **[Operon: Incremental Construction of Ragged Data via Named Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16080v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Online Inventory Balancing to Inventory Shocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16044v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classic adversarial online resource allocation problems such as AdWords, customers arrive online while products are given offline with a fixed initial inventory. To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy "inventory balancing (IB)" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)." Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial "interval assignment problem" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version in the Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2025) conference; Journal version in Operations Research (major revision)</p></details> |
| **[Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7°reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

| **[EEG Emotion Recognition Through Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15902v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corresponds to the original manuscript submitted to the 22nd EMCIS conference prior to peer review.

The model was targeted to run on 64kB RAM in bare-metal C using a custom-developed edge AI library. KWT-1 was retrained to be 369 times smaller, with only a 10% loss in accuracy through reducing output classes from 35 to 2. The retraining and quantisation reduced model size from 2.42 MB to 1.65 kB. The integration of custom RISC-V instructions that accelerated GELU and SoftMax operations enabled a 5x speedup and thus ~5x power reduction in inference, with inference clock cycle counts decreasing from 26 million to 5.5 million clock cycles while incurring a small area overhead of approximately 29%. The results demonstrate a viable method for porting and accelerating Transformer-based models in low-power IoT devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, published in the IEEE SOCC 2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Quantum Missteps in Agent-Based Modeling: A Schelling Model Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15642v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from "simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence" to "compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TI-DeepONet: Learnable Time Integration for Stable Long-Term Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17341v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate temporal extrapolation remains a fundamental challenge for neural operators modeling dynamical systems, where predictions must extend far beyond the training horizon. Conventional DeepONet approaches rely on two limited paradigms: fixed-horizon rollouts, which predict full spatiotemporal solutions while ignoring temporal causality, and autoregressive schemes, which accumulate errors through sequential prediction. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a framework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical time-stepping to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical systems while mitigating long-term error growth. Our method shifts the learning objective from direct state prediction to approximating instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then integrated using standard numerical solvers. This naturally enables continuous-time prediction and allows the use of higher-order integrators at inference than those used in training, improving both efficiency and accuracy. We further propose TI(L)-DeepONet, which incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate slopes in multi-stage integration, adapting to solution-specific dynamics and enhancing fidelity. Across four canonical PDEs featuring chaotic, dissipative, dispersive, and high-dimensional behavior, TI(L)-DeepONet slightly outperforms TI-DeepONet, and both achieve major reductions in relative L2 extrapolation error: about 81% compared to autoregressive methods and 70% compared to fixed-horizon approaches. Notably, both models maintain stable predictions over temporal domains nearly twice the training interval. This work establishes a physics-aware operator learning framework that bridges neural approximation with numerical analysis principles, addressing a key gap in long-term forecasting of complex physical systems.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DeepEN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Personalized Enteral Nutrition in Critical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08350v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ICU enteral feeding remains sub-optimal due to limited personalization and uncertainty about appropriate calorie, protein, and fluid targets, particularly under rapidly changing metabolic demands and heterogeneous patient responses. This study introduces DeepEN, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that personalizes enteral nutrition (EN) dosing for critically ill patients using electronic health record data. DeepEN was trained on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database to generate 4-hourly, patient-specific targets for caloric, protein, and fluid intake. The model's state space integrates demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and prior interventions relevant to nutritional management, while its reward function balances short-term physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival. A dueling double deep Q-network with Conservative Q-Learning regularization is used to ensure safe and reliable policy learning from retrospective data. DeepEN achieved a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17 percentage-point absolute reduction in estimated mortality compared with the clinician policy (18.8% vs 22.5%) and higher expected returns compared with guideline-based dosing (11.89 vs 8.11), with improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. U-shaped associations between deviations from clinician dosing and mortality suggest that the learned policy aligns with high-value clinician actions while diverging from suboptimal ones. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of conservative offline RL for individualized EN therapy and suggest that data-driven personalization may improve outcomes beyond guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24006v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[RS-CA-HSICT: A Residual and Spatial Channel Augmented CNN Transformer Framework for Monkeypox Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15476v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a hybrid deep learning approach, namely Residual and Spatial Learning based Channel Augmented Integrated CNN-Transformer architecture, that leverages the strengths of CNN and Transformer towards enhanced MPox detection. The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 Pa...</summary><p>33 Pages, 12 Figure, 4 Tables</p></details> |

However, identifying the right context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a reduction of up to 24.1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[QADR: A Scalable, Quantum-Resistant Protocol for Anonymous Data Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00897v6)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWR-Viz: AI-assisted Interactive Visual Analytics Framework for Ship Weather Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15182v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and sustainable maritime transport increasingly depends on reliable forecasting and adaptive routing, yet operational adoption remains difficult due to forecast latencies and the need for human judgment in rapid decision-making under changing ocean conditions. We introduce SWR-Viz, an AI-assisted visual analytics framework that combines a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator wave forecast model with SIMROUTE-based routing and interactive emissions analytics. The framework generates near-term forecasts directly from current conditions, supports data assimilation with sparse observations, and enables rapid exploration of what-if routing scenarios. We evaluate the forecast models and SWR-Viz framework along key shipping corridors in the Japan Coast and Gulf of Mexico, showing both improved forecast stability and realistic routing outcomes comparable to ground-truth reanalysis wave products. Expert feedback highlights the usability of SWR-Viz, its ability to isolate voyage segments with high emission reduction potential, and its value as a practical decision-support system. More broadly, this work illustrates how lightweight AI forecasting can be integrated with interactive visual analytics to support human-centered decision-making in complex geospatial and environmental domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Uncertainty Sets: Leveraging Optimal Transport to Extend Conformal Predictive Distribution to Multivariate Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15146v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction (CP) constructs uncertainty sets for model outputs with finite-sample coverage guarantees. A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure.</p></details> |  |

The SolarEV City Concept, linking rooftop photovoltaics with electric vehicles as mobile storage offers a technically robust pathway for deep CO2 reduction, potentially meeting 60-95 percent of municipal electricity demand when deployed synergistically. Despite rapid global growth of PVs and EVs, integration through bidirectional Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid systems has lagged, revealing a persistent SolarEV paradox. This review examines that paradox through a socio-technical framework across four dimensions, technology, economics, policy, and society. Cross-national comparison shows that while technical feasibility is well established, large-scale implementation is limited by fragmented charging-protocol standards, immature and often non-profitable V2G business models, regulatory misalignments between energy and transport sectors, and social-equity barriers that restrict participation mainly to high-income homeowners. Emerging national archetypes from Japans resilience-driven model to Europes regulation-first trajectory highlight strong path dependence in current integration strategies. The analysis concludes that advancing SolarEV Cities requires a shift from parallel PV-EV promotion toward coordinated policy frameworks, interoperable digital infrastructure, and inclusive market designs that distribute economic and resilience benefits more equitably. Achieving this integrated energy transition will require strategic collaboration among researchers, governments, industries, and communities to build adaptive, resilient, and socially just urban energy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperspectral Super-Resolution with Inter-Image Variability via Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15052v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) with multispectral image (MSI) provides an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution of HSI. However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability.</p></details> |  |

The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches. This research establishes a robust baseline for developing high-performance, energy-efficient SNN-based models for skeleton-based action recognition</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-Based Time and Cost Prediction in Project Networks: From Statistical Modeling to Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15003v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of project duration and cost remains one of the most challenging aspects of project management, particularly in resource-constrained and interdependent task networks. Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies. We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks. Furthermore, the learned embeddings provide interpretable insights into resource bottlenecks and critical dependencies, enabling more explainable and adaptive scheduling decisions.</p></details> | 52 pages, 12 figures |

Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention via Synaptic Plasticity is All You Need: A Biologically Inspired Spiking Neuromorphic Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14691v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability.

We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $π$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $μ$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincaré inequality offers improved bounds.</p></details> |  |

However, their high-dimensional, high-precision (float32) vector embeddings create significant storage and memory challenges for real-world deployment. To address this, we conduct a rigorous empirical study on the BEIR SciFact benchmark, evaluating the trade-offs between two primary compression strategies: (1) Dimensionality Reduction via deep Autoencoders (AE), reducing original 384-dim vectors to latent spaces from 384 down to 12, and (2) Precision Reduction via Quantization (float16, int8, and binary). We systematically compare each method by measuring the "performance loss" (or gain) relative to a float32 baseline across a full suite of retrieval metrics (NDCG, MAP, MRR, Recall, Precision) at various k cutoffs. Our results show that int8 scalar quantization provides the most effective "sweet spot," achieving a 4x compression with a negligible [~1-2%] drop in nDCG@10. In contrast, Autoencoders show a graceful degradation but suffer a more significant performance loss at equivalent 4x compression ratios (AE-96). binary quantization was found to be unsuitable for this task due to catastrophic performance drops. This work provides a practical guide for deploying efficient, high-performance retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code Link: https://github.com/KD-TAO/OmniZip</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Correlation: Causal Multi-View Unsupervised Feature Selection Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13763v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently received increasing attention for its promising ability in dimensionality reduction on multi-view unlabeled data. Existing MUFS methods typically select discriminative features by capturing correlations between features and clustering labels. However, an important yet underexplored question remains: \textit{Are such correlations sufficiently reliable to guide feature selection?} In this paper, we analyze MUFS from a causal perspective by introducing a novel structural causal model, which reveals that existing methods may select irrelevant features because they overlook spurious correlations caused by confounders. Building on this causal perspective, we propose a novel MUFS method called CAusal multi-view Unsupervised feature Selection leArning (CAUSA). Specifically, we first employ a generalized unsupervised spectral regression model that identifies informative features by capturing dependencies between features and consensus clustering labels. We then introduce a causal regularization module that can adaptively separate confounders from multi-view data and simultaneously learn view-shared sample weights to balance confounder distributions, thereby mitigating spurious correlations. Thereafter, integrating both into a unified learning framework enables CAUSA to select causally informative features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CAUSA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of causal multi-view feature selection in the unsupervised setting.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, streamliners were crafted manually or generated through systematically combined atomic constraints with high-effort offline testing. Our approach utilizes the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose effective streamliners for problems specified in the MiniZinc constraint programming language and integrates feedback to the LLM with quick empirical tests for validation. Evaluated across seven diverse constraint satisfaction problems, our method achieves substantial runtime reductions. We compare the results to obfuscated and disguised variants of the problem to see whether the results depend on LLM memorization. We also analyze whether longer off-line runs improve the quality of streamliners and whether the LLM can propose good combinations of streamliners.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 page; deeper analysis of streamliners and statistics about benchmark instances added</p></details> |

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?</p></details> |  |
| **[Silhouette-to-Contour Registration: Aligning Intraoral Scan Models with Cephalometric Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14343v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.</p></details> |  |

This article develops a governance design model for proportionate SME cybersecurity, grounded in an awareness-first logic and informed by the EU Squad 2025 experience. Using a qualitative policy-analysis and conceptual policy-design approach, we reconstruct a seven-dimension preventive architecture: awareness and visibility, human behaviour, access control, system hygiene, data protection, detection and response, and continuous review, and justify each dimension's contribution to proportionality and risk reduction. We then map the model's regulatory scope and limits against the NIS2 Directive, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2690, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and the EU Action Plan on Cybersecurity for Hospitals, clarifying which obligations are supported and which require complementary governance (e.g. role accountability, incident timelines, statements of applicability, sector-specific testing and procurement). The analysis argues that raising awareness is the fastest, scalable lever to increase cyber-risk sensitivity in micro-SMEs and complements, rather than replaces, formal compliance. We conclude with policy implications for EU and national programmes seeking practical, proportionate pathways to SME cyber resilience under NIS2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 5 pages, 2 tables.

Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency; fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage image compression systems. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on CLIC2020-mobile.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 as a Conference Paper (Oral Presentation)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Variance Reduction in Importance Sampling for Efficient DNN Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13296v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Importance sampling is widely used to improve the efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) training by reducing the variance of gradient estimators. However, efficiently assessing the variance reduction relative to uniform sampling remains challenging due to computational overhead. This paper proposes a method for estimating variance reduction during DNN training using only minibatches sampled under importance sampling. By leveraging the proposed method, the paper also proposes an effective minibatch size to enable automatic learning rate adjustment. An absolute metric to quantify the efficiency of importance sampling is also introduced as well as an algorithm for real-time estimation of importance scores based on moving gradient statistics. Theoretical analysis and experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed algorithm consistently reduces variance, improves training efficiency, and enhances model accuracy compared with current importance-sampling approaches while maintaining minimal computational overhead.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Parallelizing Tree Search with Twice Sequential Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14220v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.</p></details> |  |

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 - Main Technical Track</p></details> |

This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management. Future research should expand validation of this framework across the aerospace domain and other safety-critical industries with similar certification requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroPath: Neurobiology-Inspired Path Tracking and Reflection for Semantically Coherent Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14096v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, their sampling process demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. State-of-the-art methods focus on reducing the number of discrete time steps during sampling to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can also be controlled in terms of the neural network length. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its depth. Then, we apply a length consistency term during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our ODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and reduces both latency and, importantly, memory usage. CelebA-HQ and ImageNet generation experiments show a latency reduction of up to $2\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and FID improvement of up to $2.8$ points for high-quality sampling when applied to prior methods.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference. However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax, an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax, proving its convergence via exponential amplification of the gap ratio between the maximum and runner-up elements. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.</p></details> |  |

Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

Service platforms should protect data providers' legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines. Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2 times, and the explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Chromosome Parallelization for Precision Medicine Genomic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15977v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, includes appendix with additional visualizations, submitted as arXiv preprint</p></details> |

However, identifying the right context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a reduction of up to 24.1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

We introduce a multifaceted power model in which the expectation of an arbitrary number of arbitrary functions of the normalized average power is constrained. The framework generalizes existing models, recovering the standard maximal and expected power constraints and the recent mean and variance constraint as special cases. Under certain growth and continuity assumptions on the functions, our main theorem gives an exact characterization of the minimum average error probability for Gaussian channels as a function of the first- and second-order coding rates. The converse proof reduces the code design problem to minimization over a compact (under the Prokhorov metric) set of probability distributions, characterizes the extreme points of this set and invokes the Bauer's maximization principle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Timescale Model Predictive Control for Slow-Fast Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14311v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling autonomy across diverse applications. While model fidelity is crucial in MPC, solving the corresponding optimization problem in real time remains challenging when combining long horizons with high-fidelity models that capture both short-term dynamics and long-term behavior. Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Branch, or Layer? Zeroth-Order Optimization for Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12409v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Continual Learning (VLCL) has attracted significant research attention for its robust capabilities, and the adoption of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies is enabling these models to achieve competitive performance with substantially reduced resource consumption. However, dominated First-Order (FO) optimization is prone to trap models in suboptimal local minima, especially in limited exploration subspace within PEFT. To overcome this challenge, this paper pioneers a systematic exploration of adopting Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for PEFT-based VLCL. We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO adoption in VLCL due to optimization process instability. We then investigate the application of ZO optimization from a modality branch-wise to a fine-grained layer-wise across various training units to identify an optimal strategy. Besides, a key theoretical insight reveals that vision modality exhibit higher variance than language counterparts in VLCL during the ZO optimization process, and we propose a modality-aware ZO strategy, which adopts gradient sign normalization in ZO and constrains vision modality perturbation to further improve performance. Benefiting from the adoption of ZO optimization, PEFT-based VLCL fulfills better ability to escape local minima during the optimization process, extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead. Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper accepted for presentation to the 16th ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SOCC'25)</p></details> |

We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Sparsity-Enabled Multipath Perception via Structured Bayesian Inference for Multi-Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14051v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a multi-target sensing system in multipath environment, where inter-target scattering gives rise to first-order reflected paths whose angles of departure (AoDs) and angles of arrival (AoAs) coincide with the direct-path angles of different targets. Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Higher-Order Transformers With Kronecker-Structured Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02919v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern datasets are increasingly high-dimensional and multiway, often represented as tensor-valued data with multi-indexed variables. While Transformers excel in sequence modeling and high-dimensional tasks, their direct application to multiway data is computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of dot-product attention and the need to flatten inputs, which disrupts tensor structure and cross-dimensional dependencies. We propose the Higher-Order Transformer (HOT), a novel factorized attention framework that represents multiway attention as sums of Kronecker products or sums of mode-wise attention matrices. HOT efficiently captures dense and sparse relationships across dimensions while preserving tensor structure. Theoretically, HOT retains the expressiveness of full high-order attention and allows complexity control via factorization rank. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that HOT achieves competitive performance in multivariate time series forecasting and image classification, with significantly reduced computational and memory costs. Visualizations of mode-wise attention matrices further reveal interpretable high-order dependencies learned by HOT, demonstrating its versatility for complex multiway data across diverse domains. The implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/s-omranpour/HOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[FICO: Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization for Unified Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13961v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Ephemeral Gully Detection In Remote Sensing Images Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13891v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Arcee: Differentiable Recurrent State Chain for Generative Vision Modeling with Mamba SSMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11243v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a $\textbf{Logic}$-aware $\textbf{R}etrieval$-$\textbf{A}$ugmented $\textbf{G}$eneration framework ($\textbf{LogicRAG}$) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to AAAI'26</p></details> |

Classical Data Shapley (DS) provides a essential axiomatic framework for data valuation but is constrained by its symmetry axiom that assumes interchangeability of data sources. This assumption fails to capture the directional and temporal dependencies prevalent in modern ML/AI workflows, including the reliance of duplicated or augmented data on original sources and the order-specific contributions in sequential pipelines such as federated learning and multi-stage LLM fine tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce Asymmetric Data Shapley (ADS), a structure-aware data valuation framework for modern ML/AI pipelines. ADS relaxes symmetry by averaging marginal contributions only over permutations consistent with an application-specific ordering of data groups. It preserves efficiency and linearity, maintains within group symmetry and directional precedence across groups, and reduces to DS when the ordering collapses to a single group. We develop two complementary computational procedures for ADS: (i) a Monte Carlo estimator (MC-ADS) with finite-sample accuracy guarantees, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbor surrogate (KNN-ADS) that is exact and efficient for KNN predictors. Across representative settings with directional and temporal dependence, ADS consistently outperforms benchmark methods by distinguishing novel from redundant contributions and respecting the sequential nature of training. These results establish ADS as a principled and practical approach to equitable data valuation in data markets and complex ML/AI pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps, thus reducing the number of micro-scale steps required to step forward in time. In this way, our algorithm provides a ``macro-scale timestepper'' that requires less micro-scale data to still maintain accuracy, which we demonstrate with three illustrative examples: a biological agent-based model, a model of a PDE, and a model of Langevin dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

Previous LOB models require cumbersome data representations and lack adaptability outside their original tasks, leading us to introduce LOBERT, a general-purpose encoder-only foundation model for LOB data suitable for downstream fine-tuning. LOBERT adapts the original BERT architecture for LOB data by using a novel tokenization scheme that treats complete multi-dimensional messages as single tokens while retaining continuous representations of price, volume, and time. With these methods, LOBERT achieves leading performance in tasks such as predicting mid-price movements and next messages, while reducing the required context length compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for NeurIPS 2025 GenAI in Finance Workshop</p></details> |

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

This work develops a three-stage classification framework for identifying cross-$β$ structural inclusions-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease-in X-ray scattering profiles of post-mortem human brain. Stage 1 employs a Bayes-optimal classifier to separate mica substrate from tissue regions on the basis of their distinct scattering signatures. Stage 2 introduces a multicollinearityaware, class-conditional correlation pruning scheme with formal guarantees on the induced Bayes risk and approximation error, thereby reducing redundancy while retaining class-discriminative information. Stage 3 trains a compact neural network on the pruned feature set to detect the presence or absence of cross-$β$ fibrillar ordering. The top-performing model, optimized with a composite loss combining Focal and Dice objectives, attains a test F1-score of 84.30% using 11 of 211 candidate features and 174 trainable parameters. The overall framework yields an interpretable, theory-grounded strategy for data-limited classification problems involving correlated, high-dimensional experimental measurements, exemplified here by X-ray scattering profiles of neurodegenerative tissue.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, journal paper under review</p></details> |

The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget. At inference time, the fully binarized model operates with minimal compute overhead, making it exceptionally efficient and well suited for deployment on low-power digital hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sangam: Chiplet-Based DRAM-PIM Accelerator with CXL Integration for LLM Inferencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12286v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly data-intensive due to growing model sizes, and they are becoming memory-bound as the context length and, consequently, the key-value (KV) cache size increase. Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs. Sangam achieves speedup of 3.93, 4.22, 2.82x speedup in end-to-end query latency, 10.3, 9.5, 6.36x greater decoding throughput, and order of magnitude energy savings compared to an H100 GPU for varying input size, output length, and batch size on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA 3-70B, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Counting for Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07337v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF) generalize QBF by explicitly specifying which universal variables each existential variable depends on, instead of relying on a linear quantifier order. The satisfiability problem of DQBF is NEXP-complete, and many hard problems can be succinctly encoded as DQBF. Recent work has revealed a strong analogy between DQBF and SAT: k-DQBF (with k existential variables) is a succinct form of k-SAT, and satisfiability is NEXP-complete for 3-DQBF but PSPACE-complete for 2-DQBF, mirroring the complexity gap between 3-SAT (NP-complete) and 2-SAT (NL-complete). Motivated by this analogy, we study the model counting problem for DQBF, denoted #DQBF. Our main theoretical result is that #2-DQBF is #EXP-complete, where #EXP is the exponential-time analogue of #P. This parallels Valiant's classical theorem stating that #2-SAT is #P-complete. As a direct application, we show that first-order model counting (FOMC) remains #EXP-complete even when restricted to a PSPACE-decidable fragment of first-order logic and domain size two. Building on recent successes in reducing 2-DQBF satisfiability to symbolic model checking, we develop a dedicated 2-DQBF model counter. Using a diverse set of crafted instances, we experimentally evaluated it against a baseline that expands 2-DQBF formulas into propositional formulas and applies propositional model counting. While the baseline worked well when each existential variable depends on few variables, our implementation scaled significantly better to larger dependency sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conference version appears in the Proceedings of AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Isolate Trigger: Detecting and Eliminating Adaptive Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04094v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are widely deployed in various applications but remain vulnerable to stealthy adversarial threats, particularly backdoor attacks. Backdoor models trained on poisoned datasets behave normally with clean inputs but cause mispredictions when a specific trigger is present. Most existing backdoor defenses assume that adversaries only inject one backdoor with small and conspicuous triggers. However, adaptive backdoor that entangle multiple trigger patterns with benign features can effectively bypass existing defenses. To defend against these attacks, we propose Isolate Trigger (IsTr), an accurate and efficient framework for backdoor detection and mitigation. IsTr aims to eliminate the influence of benign features and reverse hidden triggers. IsTr is motivated by the observation that a model's feature extractor focuses more on benign features while its classifier focuses more on trigger patterns. Based on this difference, IsTr designs Steps and Differential-Middle-Slice to resolve the detecting challenge of isolating triggers from benign features. Moreover, IsTr employs unlearning-based repair to remove both attacker-injected and natural backdoors while maintaining model benign accuracy. We extensively evaluate IsTr against six representative backdoor attacks and compare with seven state-of-the-art baseline methods across three real-world applications: digit recognition, face recognition, and traffic sign recognition. In most cases, IsTr reduces detection overhead by an order of magnitude while achieving over 95\% detection accuracy and maintaining the post-repair attack success rate below 3\%, outperforming baseline defenses. IsTr remains robust against various adaptive attacks, even when trigger patterns are heavily entangled with benign features.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS). 12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

UGLMS is a closed-loop test strategy that adaptively selects SAR ADC code edges based on model uncertainty and refines a behavioral mismatch model in real time via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), eliminating full-range sweeps and offline post-processing. We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs. These improvements enable real-time, production-ready SAR ADC linearity testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, this is the preprint version of the paper accepted for publication at ATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Seeing the Forest and the Trees: Query-Aware Tokenizer for Long-Video Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11910v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage. Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence. We will make all code, data, and trained models' weights publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[NervePool: A Simplicial Pooling Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06315v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For deep learning problems on graph-structured data, pooling layers are important for down sampling, reducing computational cost, and to minimize overfitting. We define a pooling layer, nervePool, for data structured as simplicial complexes, which are generalizations of graphs that include higher-dimensional simplices beyond vertices and edges; this structure allows for greater flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships. The proposed simplicial coarsening scheme is built upon partitions of vertices, which allow us to generate hierarchical representations of simplicial complexes, collapsing information in a learned fashion. NervePool builds on the learned vertex cluster assignments and extends to coarsening of higher dimensional simplices in a deterministic fashion. While in practice the pooling operations are computed via a series of matrix operations, the topological motivation is a set-theoretic construction based on unions of stars of simplices and the nerve complex.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[First-Order Error Matters: Accurate Compensation for Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11017v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by performing a first-order Taylor expansion around the pre-quantization weights. This yields an approximation based on the difference between latent and full-precision weights as well as the Hessian matrix. When substituted into the theoretical solution, the formulation eliminates the need to explicitly compute the Hessian, thereby avoiding the high computational cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient methods. This design introduces only minimal additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 17.3% and increases the 5-shot MMLU accuracy from 53.8% achieved by GPTAQ to 56.1%. Moreover, FOEM can be seamlessly combined with advanced techniques such as SpinQuant, delivering additional gains under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting and further narrowing the performance gap with full-precision baselines, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

The model trade-offs introduced by this shift remain underexplored, and our goal is to study them. We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline. DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 3 figures, technical report</p></details> |

However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively.

| **[NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18041v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models (VLMs) excel at tasks involving single images or short videos, they still struggle with Long Video Question Answering (LVQA) due to its demand for complex multi-step temporal reasoning. Vanilla approaches, which simply sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM along with the question, incur significant token overhead. This forces aggressive downsampling of long videos, causing models to miss fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, and key temporal cues. Recent works attempt to overcome these limitations through heuristic approaches; however, they lack explicit mechanisms for encoding temporal relationships and fail to provide any formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic required by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA first translates a natural language question into a logic specification that models the temporal relationship between frame-level events. Next, we construct a video automaton to model the video's frame-by-frame event progression, and finally employ model checking to compare the automaton against the specification to identify all video segments that satisfy the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on the LongVideoBench and CinePile LVQA benchmarks show that NeuS-QA significantly improves performance by over 10%, particularly on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step reasoning. We open-source our code at https://utaustin-swarmlab.github.io/NeuS-QA/.</p></details> |  |

Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.</p></details> |  |

This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.</p></details> | 2 figures 7 pages |

Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (oral) |

However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g., Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g., number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. We also empirically show that enhancing mixing properties is highly beneficial when combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Middleware'25, 13 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale, community-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of challenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we develop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a representative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain language subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available model is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To facilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse selection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that drastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced zero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale version but at a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=zl3pfz4VCV</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural ODEs with Scale-Aware Residuals for Learning Stiff Biophysical Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11734v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural differential equations offer a powerful framework for modeling continuous-time dynamics, but forecasting stiff biophysical systems remains unreliable. Standard Neural ODEs and physics informed variants often require orders of magnitude more iterations, and even then may converge to suboptimal solutions that fail to preserve oscillatory frequency or amplitude. We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Uncertainty Trends for Timely Retrieval in Dynamic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09980v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.</p></details> | AAAI'26, Oral Paper |
| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Debiased Machine Learning for Smooth Functionals of Nonparametric M-Estimands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11868v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a unified framework for automatic debiased machine learning (autoDML) to simplify inference for a broad class of statistical parameters. It applies to any smooth functional of a nonparametric \emph{M-estimand}, defined as the minimizer of a population risk over an infinite-dimensional linear space. Examples of M-estimands include counterfactual regression, quantile, and survival functions, as well as conditional average treatment effects. Rather than requiring manual derivation of influence functions, the framework automates the construction of debiased estimators using three components: the gradient and Hessian of the loss function and a linear approximation of the target functional. Estimation reduces to solving two risk minimization problems -- one for the M-estimand and one for a Riesz representer. The framework accommodates Neyman-orthogonal loss functions depending on nuisance parameters and extends to vector-valued M-estimands through joint risk minimization. For functionals of M-estimands, we characterize the efficient influence function and construct efficient autoDML estimators via one-step correction, targeted minimum loss estimation, and sieve-based plug-in methods. Under quadratic risk, these estimators exhibit double robustness for linear functionals. We further show they are insensitive to mild misspecification of the M-estimand model, incurring only second-order bias. We illustrate the method by estimating long-term survival probabilities under a semiparametric beta-geometric model.</p></details> |  |

However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03972v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions, a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks: flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration, while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers seeking to tune the variability of RNN solutions, either to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model the individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging VLMs and Embodied Intelligence with Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16602v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Multimodal Representation Learning for Spatio-Temporally Explicit Environmental Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11706v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation (EO) foundation models have emerged as an effective approach to derive latent representations of the Earth system from various remote sensing sensors. These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (incliding 2 pages of references), 7 figures</p></details> |

However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Solution and Learning of Robust Factored MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00707v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs. Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16468v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling of Clinical Time Series via Latent Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16427v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods we present ML-MIX, a CPU- and GPU-compatible LAMMPS package to accelerate simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities allowing deployment of modern MLIPs even under restricted computational budgets. We demonstrate our method for ACE, UF3, SNAP and MACE potential architectures and demonstrate how linear 'cheap' potentials can be distilled from a given 'expensive' potential, allowing close matching in relevant regions of configuration space. The functionality of ML-MIX is demonstrated through tests on point defects in Si, Fe and W-He, in which speedups of up to 11x over ~ 8,000 atoms are demonstrated, without sacrificing accuracy. The scientific potential of ML-MIX is demonstrated via two case studies in W, measuring the mobility of b = 1/2 111 screw dislocations with ACE/ACE mixing and the implantation of He with MACE/SNAP mixing. The latter returns He reflection coefficients which (for the first time) match experimental observations up to an He incident energy of 80 eV - demonstrating the benefits of deploying state-of-the-art models on large, realistic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 17 figures.

One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment. This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale. On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence. This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), November, 2025</p></details> |

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.</p></details> | 2 Figures, 1 Table |

Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Their bio-inspired dynamics align well with spiking neural networks (SNNs), offering a promising energy-efficient alternative to conventional vision systems. However, SNNs remain costly to train due to temporal coding, which limits their practical deployment. To alleviate the high training cost of SNNs, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Phase-Aligned Condensation for Events), the first dataset distillation framework to SNNs and event-based vision. PACE distills a large training dataset into a compact synthetic one that enables fast SNN training, which is achieved by two core modules: \textbf{ST-DSM} and \textbf{PEQ-N}. ST-DSM uses residual membrane potentials to densify spike-based features (SDR) and to perform fine-grained spatiotemporal matching of amplitude and phase (ST-SM), while PEQ-N provides a plug-and-play straight through probabilistic integer quantizer compatible with standard event-frame pipelines. Across DVS-Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-MNIST datasets, PACE outperforms existing coreset selection and dataset distillation baselines, with particularly strong gains on dynamic event streams and at low or moderate IPC. Specifically, on N-MNIST, it achieves \(84.4\%\) accuracy, about \(85\%\) of the full training set performance, while reducing training time by more than \(50\times\) and storage cost by \(6000\times\), yielding compact surrogates that enable minute-scale SNN training and efficient edge deployment.</p></details> |  |

Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff.

A Multimodal Benchmark for Assessing Deception in Multi-Party Social Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16221v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Uncertainty via Automation: Observing, Analyzing, and Optimizing Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11277v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems - collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges. This paper presents our vision of AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles - developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users - each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems - not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.</p></details> |  |

While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

Traditional optimizations of the I/O stack aim to improve peak performance but are often workload specific and require deep expertise, making them difficult to generalize or re-use. In shared HPC environments, resource congestion can lead to unpredictable performance, causing slowdowns and timeouts. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates. Our approach leverages a small set of runtime system load metrics to reduce congestion and enhance performance stability. We implement a controller in a multi-node cluster and evaluate it on a real testbed under a representative workload. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates I/O congestion, reducing total runtime by up to 20% and lowering tail latency, while maintaining stable performance.</p></details> |  |

Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling temporal hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01408v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks representing social, biological, technological or other systems are often characterized by higher-order interaction involving any number of nodes. Temporal hypergraphs are given by ordered sequences of hyperedges representing sets of nodes interacting at given points in time. In this paper we discuss how a recently proposed model family for time-stamped hyperedges - relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - can be employed to define tailored null distributions for temporal hypergraphs and to test and control for complex dependencies in hypergraph dynamics. RHEM can be specified with a given vector of temporal hyperedge statistics - functions that quantify the structural position of hyperedges in the history of previous hyperedges - and equate expected values of these statistics with their empirically observed values. This allows, for instance, to analyze the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of temporal hyperedge configurations in a model that reproduces the observed distributions of possibly complex sub-configurations, including but going beyond node degrees. Concrete examples include, but are not limited to, preferential attachment, repetition of subsets of any given size, triadic closure, homophily, and degree assortativity for subsets of any order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning via Geometric Projection Reference Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16139v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents SGLANG-LSM, a database-inspired system that leverages Log-Structured Merge- tree (LSM-tree) architectures for scalable KV cache management. SGLANG-LSM implements a layered system design with three coordinated components: (1) a prefix-preserving storage engine that maintains token sequence locality while efficiently storing large KV cache tensors through key-value separation, (2) an adaptive controller that dynamically optimizes LSM-tree configurations based on shifting workload characteristics, and (3) runtime services including batch opera- tions and automatic resource management for production deployment. Evaluation on large-scale dynamic workloads demonstrates that SGLANG-LSM significantly improves cache hits by up to 143% and reduces TTFT by up to 24% compared to state-of-the-art systems, representing the first systematic application of database storage architectures to large-scale LLM cache management.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operon: Incremental Construction of Ragged Data via Named Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16080v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barrier-Riccati Synthesis for Nonlinear Safe Control with Expanded Region of Attraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15453v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Riccati-based framework for safety-critical nonlinear control that integrates the barrier states (BaS) methodology with the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach. The BaS formulation embeds safety constraints into the system dynamics via auxiliary states, enabling safety to be treated as a control objective. To overcome the limited region of attraction in linear BaS controllers, we extend the framework to nonlinear systems using SDRE synthesis applied to the barrier-augmented dynamics and derive a matrix inequality condition that certifies forward invariance of a large region of attraction and guarantees asymptotic safe stabilization. The resulting controller is computed online via pointwise Riccati solutions. We validate the method on an unstable constrained system and cluttered quadrotor navigation tasks, demonstrating improved constraint handling, scalability, and robustness near safety boundaries. This framework offers a principled and computationally tractable solution for synthesizing nonlinear safe feedback in safety-critical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiSTAR: Ray-Centric World Models for 4D LiDAR Sequences in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16049v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

To achieve this, items are selected so that their difficulty closely matches the test taker's estimated ability at each stage of the test. This alignment implies that the probability of a correct answer tends toward 0.5. However, in practical settings, this probability may not converge to 0.5 unless the test comprises a sufficiently large number of items. This could give the impression that the adaptive mechanism is not functioning properly. Nevertheless, even when the number of items is small, such as 5 or 7, the adaptive nature of the system can still be observed by examining the relationship between item difficulty and the mean estimated ability of examinees for the corresponding item. Considering that each item typically requires about 2-5 minutes to solve, this number of items appears to be a practical choice that avoids excessive fatigue for test-takers.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 13 figures; added argument in section 4</p></details> |

The communication patterns in such systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized due to the spiking nature of neural events, characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of traffic. These characteristics necessitate interconnects optimized for handling high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Dynamic segmented bus has been proposed a promising interconnect for its simplicity, scalability and low power consumption. However, deploying spiking neural network applications on such buses presents challenges, including substantial inter-cluster traffic, which can lead to network congestion, spike loss, and unnecessary energy expenditure. In this paper, we propose a three-step process to deploy SNN applications on dynamic segmented buses aiming to reduce spike loss and conserve energy. Firstly, we formulate optimization heuristics to mitigate spike loss and energy consumption based on application connectivity. Secondly, we analyze the application traffic to determine spike schedules that minimize traffic flooding. Lastly, we propose a routing algorithm to minimize spike traffic path crossings. We evaluate our approach using a cycle-accurate network simulator. The simulation results show that our algorithms can eliminate spike loss while keeping energy consumption significantly lower compared to conventional NoCs.</p></details> |  |

In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 24 figures.

The communication patterns in these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency. Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |

Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a large variety of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering and comparing centrality measures.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</p></details> | 6 pages |

This raises concerns about provenance, ownership, and integrity. Watermarking can help address these issues by embedding metadata directly into the content. To work well, a watermark needs enough capacity for meaningful metadata. It must also stay imperceptible and remain robust to common video manipulations. Existing methods struggle with limited capacity, extra inference cost, or reduced visual quality. We introduce VidStamp, a watermarking framework that embeds frame-level messages through the decoder of a latent video diffusion model. The decoder is fine-tuned in two stages. The first stage uses static image datasets to encourage spatial message separation. The second stage uses synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency. This approach enables high-capacity watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. VidStamp also supports dynamic watermarking through a control signal that selects message templates during inference. This adds flexibility and creates a second channel for communication. We evaluate VidStamp on Stable Video Diffusion (I2V), OpenSora, and Wan (T2V). The system embeds 48 bits per frame while preserving visual quality and staying robust to common distortions. Compared with VideoSeal, VideoShield, and RivaGAN, it achieves lower log P-values and stronger detectability. Its frame-wise watermarking design also enables precise temporal tamper localization, with an accuracy of 0.96, which exceeds the VideoShield baseline.

Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[MoE-CAP: Benchmarking Cost, Accuracy and Performance of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07067v6)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AquaSentinel: Next-Generation AI System Integrating Sensor Networks for Urban Underground Water Pipeline Anomaly Detection via Collaborative MoE-LLM Agent Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15870v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underground pipeline leaks and infiltrations pose significant threats to water security and environmental safety. Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, Accepted to the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026), IAAI Deployed Applications Track</p></details> |
| **[The Subtle Art of Defection: Understanding Uncooperative Behaviors in LLM based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15862v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and analyzing how uncooperative behaviors can destabilize or collapse LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
