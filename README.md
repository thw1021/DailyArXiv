| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Active Flow Control around a Three-Dimensional Flow-Separated Wing at Re = 1,000](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10195v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) to reduce flow separation on wings at high angles of attack. Concretely, here the DRL agent controls the flow over the three-dimensional NACA0012 wing section at the Reynolds number Re = 1,000 and angle of attack AoA = 20 degrees, autonomously identifying optimal control actions through real-time flow data and a reward function focused on improving aerodynamic performance. The framework integrates the GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver SOD2D with the TF-Agents DRL library via a Redis in-memory database, enabling rapid training. This work builds on previous DRL flow-control studies, demonstrating DRL potential to address complex aerodynamic challenges and push the boundaries of traditional AFC methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Integrated Open Source Software System for the Generation and Analysis of Subject-Specific Blood Flow Simulation Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09392v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objective: Hemodynamic analysis of blood flow through arteries and veins is critical for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, such as aneurysms and stenoses, and for investigating cardiovascular parameters, such as turbulence and wall shear stress. For subject-specific analyses, the anatomy and blood flow of the subject can be captured non-invasively using structural and 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on the other hand, can be used to generate blood flow simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. To generate and analyze subject-specific blood flow simulations, MRI and CFD have to be brought together. Methods: We present an interactive, customizable, and user-oriented visual analysis tool that assists researchers in both medicine and numerical analysis. Our open-source tool is applicable to domains such as CFD and MRI, and it facilitates the analysis of simulation results and medical data, especially in hemodynamic studies. It enables the creation of simulation ensembles with a high variety of parameters. Furthermore, it allows for the visual and analytical examination of simulations and measurements through 2D embeddings of the similarity space. Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we applied it to three real-world use cases, showcasing its ability to configure simulation ensembles and analyse blood flow dynamics. We evaluated our example cases together with MRI and CFD experts to further enhance features and increase the usability. Conclusions: By combining the strengths of both CFD and MRI, our tool provides a more comprehensive understanding of hemodynamic parameters, facilitating more accurate analysis of hemodynamic biomarkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with deformable interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Physics Reasoning and Performance Taxonomy in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08270v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics, remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over 400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Train Operator Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08071v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a tensor--train framework for nonintrusive operator inference aimed at learning discrete operators and using them to predict solutions of physical governing equations. Our framework comprises three approaches: full--order tensor--train operator inference, full--order quantized tensor--train operator inference, and reduced--order tensor--train operator inference. In each case, snapshot data is represented in tensor--train format--either through compression or cross interpolation--enabling the efficient handling of extremely large datasets with significantly reduced computational effort compared to standard methods. The effectiveness of each approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments related to Computational Fluid Dynamics and benchmarked against the standard reduced--order operator inference method, highlighting the advantages of the tensor--train representations in both accuracy and scalability.</p></details> | AIAA SciTech 2026 |
| **[Mixed-precision numerics in scientific applications: survey and perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19322v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads has led to a significant increase in silicon area dedicated to lower-precision computations on recent high-performance computing hardware designs. However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this survey, we (1) review progress across diverse scientific domains -- including fluid dynamics, weather and climate, quantum chemistry, and computational genomics -- that have begun adopting mixed-precision strategies; (2) examine state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques such as iterative refinement, splitting and emulation schemes, and adaptive precision solvers; (3) assess their implications for accuracy, performance, and resource utilization; and (4) survey the emerging software ecosystem that enables mixed-precision methods at scale. We conclude with perspectives and recommendations on cross-cutting opportunities, domain-specific challenges, and the role of co-design between application scientists, numerical analysts and computer scientists. Collectively, this survey underscores that mixed-precision numerics can reshape computational science by aligning algorithms with the evolving landscape of hardware capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of Supercomputing</p></details> |
| **[ChatCFD: An LLM-Driven Agent for End-to-End CFD Automation with Domain-Specific Structured Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02019v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for advancing scientific and engineering fields but is hindered by operational complexity, high expertise requirements, and limited accessibility. This paper introduces ChatCFD, an automated agent system for OpenFOAM simulations that processes multi-modal inputs (e.g., research papers, meshes) via an interactive interface, leveraging DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 large language models, a multi-agent architecture, and OpenFOAM knowledge. Its four-stage pipeline (Knowledge Base Construction, User Input Processing, Case File Generation, and Execution and Error Reflection) enables iterative trial-reflection-refinement for intricate setups, supporting diverse physical models and external meshes. Validation on 205 benchmark tutorial cases, 110 perturbed variants, and 2 literature-derived cases shows ChatCFD's 82.1 percent operational success rate on basic cases, outperforming MetaOpenFOAM (6.2 percent) and Foam-Agent (42.3 percent), and 60-80 percent on literature-derived complex cases. Turbulence model studies show a 40 percent success rate for common models versus 10 percent for rare ones like RNG k-epsilon. Physics coupling analyses reveal higher resource demands for multi-physics-coupled cases, while LLM bias toward simpler setups introduces persistent errors, such as dimensional inconsistency. Ablation studies highlight the efficacy of RAG-based modules and reflection mechanisms. By automating hypothesis testing and parameter exploration, ChatCFD accelerates scientific discovery in fluid mechanics and engineering, addressing LLM limitations through structured design and showing strong potential as a modular component in MCP-based agent networks for collaborative multi-agent systems, paving the way for scalable AI-driven CFD innovation. The code for ChatCFD is available at https://github.com/ConMoo/ChatCFD.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A novel biomass fluidized bed gasification model coupled with machine learning and CFD simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06056v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A coupling model of biomass fluidized bed gasification based on machine learning and computational fluid dynamics is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of complex thermochemical reaction process. By constructing a high-quality data set based on experimental data and high fidelity simulation results, the agent model used to describe the characteristics of reaction kinetics was trained and embedded into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework to realize the real-time update of reaction rate and composition evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Stage Graph Neural Networks for Data-Driven Prediction of Natural Convection in Enclosed Cavities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06041v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPINN: An Optimal Self-Supervised Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05886v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks. Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Transfer Dynamics Generated by Non-Axisymmetric Tornado-Type Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05546v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy cascade in turbulence, first statistically described by Richardson (1922) and Kolmogorov (1941), lacked connection to the underlying fluid dynamics. Recent numerical studies of Goto et al. (2017) and Yoneda et al. (2022) revealed scale-local energy transfer via vortex stretching but remained within spatial statistics. This study aims to uncover the time-dependent elementary process behind the energy cascade by constructing a tornado-type flow in a non-axisymmetric curved cylindrical domain. Our approach reveals specific vortex dynamics responsible for energy transfer, offering new insight into the physical mechanisms of turbulence.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Entropy stable finite difference methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity and knapsack limiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.14488</p></details> |
| **[A novel approach to study the wellposedness of the 3D fluid-2D plate interaction PDE System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03431v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a certain fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system with a view of obtaining an alternative methodology for establishing its strongly continuous semigroup wellposedness. (Semigroup generation for this FSI was originally considered in Avalos-Clark (2014).) The FSI model under consideration describes the vibrations of an incompressible fluid within a 3D cavity as it interacts with the elastic membrane on the ``free" upper boundary of the cavity. Such coupled PDE systems appear in variety of natural settings such as biomedicine, aeroelasticity, and fluid dynamics. Our proof of $C_0$-semigroup wellposedness is based on a proper application of Lumer Phillips Theorem. In this regard, our main challenge is to show the maximality of the corresponding semigroup generator. To this end, we develop a ``nonstandard" inf-sup approach which avoids the use of technical nonlocal maps in the associated bilinear forms--unlike the earlier paper Avalos-Clark (2014)--and allows for the solution of the fluid and plate solution variables simultanously. Our new inf-sup strategy will lead to a more efficient mixed finite element method (FEM) for approximating solutions to the FSI problem, inasmuch our novel variational formulation avoids bilinear forms which are free from the computationally-intensive nonlocal solution operators invoked in Avalos-Clark (2014). We also perform numerical tests based on this formulation using a benchmark problem and present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Computational Fluid Dynamics Optimization of F1 Front Wing using Physics Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01963v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results, require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24 hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12 aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination (R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of design space within regulatory constraints.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Towards Digital Twins for Optimal Radioembolization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02607v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability. To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support. Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluate Neighbor Search for Curve-based Vector Field Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00180v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space, popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap, this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings that were overlooked by the community.</p></details> | 12 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Active Learning for Deep Learning-Based Hemodynamic Parameter Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03453v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hemodynamic parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress play an important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in cardiovascular diseases. These parameters can be accurately computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive. Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained. These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to difficult cases. Our results show that active learning is a feasible strategy to increase the potential of deep learning-based CFD surrogates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep vectorised operators for pulsatile hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries from a steady-state prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11920v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in silico. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation-independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure (approximation disparity 0.368 $\pm$ 0.079) while being agnostic ($p < 0.05$ in a one-way ANOVA test) to re-sampling of the source domain, i.e. discretisation-independent. This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine"</p></details> |
| **[Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Discovery and Formulation Refines the Quasi-Steady Model of Flapping-Wing Aerodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18703v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology, physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs: high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models, we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Improving Long-term Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Predictions: A Proof of Concept with Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18565v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost. Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Transformers for Mesh-Based Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18051v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

| **[Beyond Blur: A Fluid Perspective on Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16827v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques.

| **[The compressible Neural Particle Method for Simulating Compressible Viscous Fluid Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16916v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking. However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks. The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step, and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility. The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PASJ</p></details> |

OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fluid Dynamics and Domain Reconstruction from Noisy Flow Images Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Quasi-Conformal Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11216v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

These Interactive AI systems adapt to users over time, build ongoing relationships, and even can take proactive actions on behalf of users. This new paradigm requires us to rethink how such human-AI interactions can be studied effectively to inform governance and policy development. In this paper, we draw on insights from a collaborative interdisciplinary workshop with policymakers, behavioral scientists, Human-Computer Interaction researchers, and civil society practitioners, to identify challenges and methodological opportunities arising within new forms of human-AI interactions. Based on these insights, we discuss an outcome-focused regulatory approach that integrates behavioral insights to address both the risks and benefits of emerging human-AI relationships. In particular, we emphasize the need for new methods to study the fluid, dynamic, and context-dependent nature of these interactions. We provide practical recommendations for developing human-centric AI governance, informed by behavioral insights, that can respond to the complexities of Interactive AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of AAAI/ACM Conference AIES 2025</p></details> |

While machine learning approaches offer computing acceleration, they typically specialize in single physical systems or require extensive training data, hindering their applicability in highly nonlinear and 3D flow scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniFluids, a pure physics pre-trained model that captures fundamental fluid dynamics laws and adapts efficiently to diverse downstream tasks with minimal data. We develop a training framework combining physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. This enables OmniFluids to retain broad physics knowledge while delivering fast and accurate predictions. Architecturally, OmniFluids integrates a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, seamlessly incorporating physics-based supervision while allowing efficient and scalable modeling of diverse tasks. Extensive tests on a broad range of 2D and 3D benchmarks show that OmniFluids outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in terms of flow field prediction and turbulence statistics. It delivers 10--100$\times$ speedups over traditional solvers while maintaining a comparable accuracy and accurately identifies unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work demonstrates the potential of training a unified CFD solver exclusively from physics knowledge, offering a new approach for efficient and generalizable modeling across complex fluid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffeomorphic Neural Operator Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06690v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an operator learning approach for a class of evolution operators using a composition of a learned lift into the space of diffeomorphisms of the domain and the group action on the field space. In turn, this transforms the semigroup structure of the evolution operator into a corresponding group structure allowing time stepping be performed through composition on the space of diffeomorphisms rather than in the field space directly. This results in a number of structure-preserving properties related to preserving a relabelling symmetry of the dynamics as a hard constraint. We study the resolution properties of our approach, along with its connection to the techniques of diffeomorphic image registration. Numerical experiments on forecasting turbulent fluid dynamics are provided, demonstrating its conservative properties, non-diffusivity, and ability to capture anticipated statistical scaling relations at sub-grid scales. Our method provides an example of geometric operator learning and indicates a clear performance benefit from leveraging a priori known infinite-dimensional geometric structure.</p></details> |  |

By making use of modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was finally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran. This highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely adopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support for the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to recede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08 bindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by implementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard version 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By implementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for MPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The implementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08 wrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a spectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this work, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the implementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key component of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately 50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python pympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from the MPI standard.</p></details> |  |

Numerical and parallel scalability of these methods can be achieved by adding coarse levels. A successful coarse space, inspired by iterative substructuring, is the generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) space. In https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1184047, based on the GDSW approach, two-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for saddle point problems were introduced. We present parallel results up to 32768 MPI ranks for the solution of incompressible fluid problems for a Poiseuille flow example on the unit cube and a complex extrusion die geometry using a two- and a three-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. These results are achieved through the combination of the additive overlapping Schwarz solvers implemented in the Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56750-7_19, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.64, and the FEATFLOW library http://www.featflow.de using a scalable interface for the efficient coupling of the two libraries.

While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging, financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics via the shallow water equations.

Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; name changed, added references, polished language, expanded appendix</p></details> |

| **[Efficient High-Order Participation Factor Computation via Batch-Structured Tensor Contraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08968v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</p></details> |  |

These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons.

We wish to explain the observed phenomena in terms of latent states which, in the case of neuronal activity, might correspond to subnetworks of neurons within a brain or organoid. Many existing approaches assume that only one latent state can be active at a time, in contrast to our domain knowledge. We propose a switching dynamical system based on the factorial hidden Markov model. Unlike existing approaches, our model acknowledges that neuronal activity can be caused by multiple subnetworks, which may be activated either jointly or independently. A change in one part of the network does not mean that the entire connectivity pattern will change. We pair our model with scalable variational inference algorithm, using a concrete relaxation of the underlying factorial hidden Markov model, to effectively infer the latent states and model parameters. We show that our algorithm can recover ground-truth structure and yield insights about the maturation of neuronal activity in microelectrode array recordings from in vitro neuronal cultures.</p></details> |  |

In such approaches, information about data points from past trajectories in phase space is used to reconstruct the equations of motion and to predict future solutions that have not been observed before. However, in many cases, the available data does not correspond to the variables that define the system's phase space. We focus our attention on the important example of dissipative dynamical systems. In that case, the phase space consists of coordinates, momenta and entropies; however, the momenta and entropies cannot, in general, be observed directly. To address this difficulty, we develop an efficient data-based computing framework based exclusively on observable variables, by constructing a novel approach based on the \emph{thermodynamic Lagrangian}, and constructing neural networks that respect the thermodynamics and guarantees the non-decreasing entropy evolution. We show that our network can provide an efficient description of phase space evolution based on a limited number of data points and a relatively small number of parameters in the system.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

Such systems play an important role in a variety of fields ranging from biology and physics to sociology and economics. Global information about the behavior of complex dynamical systems can be obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated transfer operators such as the Perron--Frobenius operator and the Koopman operator. In this paper, we extend transfer operator theory to McKean--Vlasov equations and show how extended dynamic mode decomposition and the Galerkin projection methodology can be used to compute finite-dimensional approximations of these operators, which allows us to compute spectral properties and thus to identify slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns or to detect metastable sets. The results will be illustrated with the aid of several guiding examples and benchmark problems including the Cormier model, the Kuramoto model, and a three-dimensional generalization of the Kuramoto model.</p></details> |  |

We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference.

Sparse regression techniques, exemplified by the Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) framework, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting parsimonious models from time series data. However, real-world dynamical systems are driven by input control, external forces, or human interventions, which standard ARGOS does not accommodate. To address this, we introduce ARGOS with control (ARGOSc), an extension of ARGOS that incorporates external control inputs into the system identification process. ARGOSc extends the sparse regression framework to infer governing equations while accounting for the effects of exogenous inputs, enabling robust identification of forcing dynamics in low- to medium-noise datasets. We demonstrate ARGOSc efficacy on benchmark systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Lotka-Volterra, and the Lorenz system with forcing and feedback control, showing enhanced accuracy in discovering governing laws. Under the noisy conditions, ARGOSc outperforms the widely used sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDYc), in accurately identifying the underlying forced dynamics. In some cases, SINDYc fails to capture the true system dynamics, whereas ARGOSc consistently succeeds.</p></details> |  |

The recently proposed decoupled multi-probability density evolution method (decoupled M-PDEM) is employed to numerically solve the conditional PDF for complex dynamical systems. Several numerical examples illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed framework.

The system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach, including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation Strategies for Nonlinear Feedback Control Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07439v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the stabilization of dynamical systems in the infinite horizon optimal control setting using nonlinear feedback control based on State-Dependent Riccati Equations (SDREs). While effective, the practical implementation of such feedback strategies is often constrained by the high dimensionality of state spaces and the computational challenges associated with solving SDREs, particularly in parametric scenarios. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) methodology, which provides an efficient and accurate framework for addressing high-dimensional feedback control problems. DLRA dynamically constructs a compact, low-dimensional representation that evolves with the problem, enabling the simultaneous resolution of multiple parametric instances in real-time. We propose two novel algorithms to enhance numerical performances: the cascade-Newton-Kleinman method and Riccati-based DLRA (R-DLRA). The cascade-Newton-Kleinman method accelerates convergence by leveraging Riccati solutions from the nearby parameter or time instance, supported by a theoretical sensitivity analysis. R-DLRA integrates Riccati information into the DLRA basis construction to improve the quality of the solution. These approaches are validated through nonlinear one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases showing transport-like behavior, demonstrating that R-DLRA outperforms standard DLRA and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based model order reduction in both speed and accuracy, offering a superior alternative to Full Order Model solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[KoopMotion: Learning Almost Divergence Free Koopman Flow Fields for Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09074v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning). 15 pages 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Single-Stage Optimization of Open-loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth, Symbolic Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10647v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-loop stable limit cycles are foundational to legged robotics, providing inherent self-stabilization that minimizes the need for computationally intensive feedback-based gait correction. While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients. Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties. As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Numerical modeling of elastic waves in thin shells with grid-characteristic method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09017v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical modeling of strength and non-destructive testing of complex structures such as buildings, space rockets or oil reservoirs often involves calculations on extremely large grids. The modeling of elastic wave processes in solids places limitations on the grid element size because resolving different elastic waves requires at least several grid elements for the characteristic size of the modeled object. For a thin plate, the defining size is its thickness, and a complex structure that contains large-scale thin objects requires a large-scale grid to preserve its uniformity. One way to bypass this problem is the theory of thin plates and shells that replaces a simple material model on a fine three-dimensional mesh with a more complex material model on a coarser mesh. This approach loses certain fine effects inside the thin plate, but allows us to model large and complex thin objects with a reasonable size calculation grid and resolve all the significant wave types. In this research, we take the Kirchhoff-Love material model and derive a hyperbolic dynamic system of equations that allows for a physical interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system is solved numerically with a grid-characteristic method. Numerical results for several model statements are compared with three-dimensional calculations based on grid-characteristic method for a three dimensional elasticity.</p></details> |  |
