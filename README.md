| **[Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems. GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction. We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions. Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EddyFormer: Accelerated Neural Simulations of Three-Dimensional Turbulence at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24173v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM) architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features. We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows, EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALM-PDE: Continuous and Adaptive Convolutions for Latent Space Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12944v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025, San Diego, California, USA</p></details> |
| **[The inverse initial data problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations via Legendre time reduction method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16810v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the inverse initial data problem for the compressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial velocity field from lateral boundary observations. This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding diffusion models to reconstruct flow fields from sparse data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19971v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/tum-pbs/sparse-reconstruction</p></details> |
| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Residual-guided AI-CFD hybrid method enables stable and scalable simulations: from 2D benchmarks to 3D applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21804v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning (ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable, accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in real-world engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16992v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code at https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT</p></details> |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unconditionally Stable, Variable Step DLN Methods for the Allen-Cahn Active Fluid Model: A Divergence-free Preserving Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16860v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the divergence-free mixed finite element method (FEM) for nonlinear fourth-order Allen-Cahn phase field coupled active fluid equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$, the original fourth-order problem is converted into a system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-comforming finite element spaces. To further refine the formulation, an additional auxiliary variable $\xi$, analogous to the pressure, is introduced, resulting in a mixed finite element scheme that preserves the divergence-free condition in $which = \Delta u$ inherited from the model. A fully discrete scheme is then established by combining the spatial approximation by the divergence-free mixed finite element method with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme is rigorously derived under suitable regularity assumptions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on the minimum dissipation criterion is carried out to enhance computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrivAerStar: An Industrial-Grade CFD Dataset for Vehicle Aerodynamic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16857v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16399v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AB-UPT for Automotive and Aerospace Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15808v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) shows strong capabilities to replicate automotive computational fluid dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both datasets were generated with the Luminary Cloud platform containing automotives (SHIFT-SUV) and aircrafts (SHIFT-Wing). We start by detailing the data generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model. AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near perfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a simple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a day on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNO: Multiscale Neural Operator for Computational Fluid Dynamics with 3D Point Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16071v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Clifford-Steerable CNNs with Complete Kernel Basis for PDE Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our method consistently outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address the oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a number of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These examples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying property tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and useful, remains to be seen.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings VSS 2025, arXiv:2510.12314</p></details> |

First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Prior for First Order Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20278v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design optimization aims to infer system parameters from observed solutions, posing critical challenges across domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, structural engineering, materials science, and fluid dynamics. The lack of explicit mathematical representations in many systems complicates this process and makes the first order optimization impossible. Mainstream approaches, including generative AI and Bayesian optimization, address these challenges but have limitations. Generative AI is computationally expensive, while Bayesian optimization, relying on surrogate models, suffers from scalability, sensitivity to priors, and noise issues, often leading to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces Deep Physics Prior (DPP), a novel method enabling first-order gradient-based inverse optimization with surrogate machine learning models. By leveraging pretrained auxiliary Neural Operators, DPP enforces prior distribution constraints to ensure robust and meaningful solutions. This approach is particularly effective when prior data and observation distributions are unknown.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Constrained Sensing and Reliable State Estimation with Shallow Recurrent Decoders on a TRIGA Mark II Reactor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12368v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel data-driven methodology able to provide accurate state estimation in engineering systems, such as nuclear reactors. This deep learning architecture is a robust technique designed to map the temporal trajectories of a few sparse measures to the full state space, including unobservable fields, which is agnostic to sensor positions and able to handle noisy data through an ensemble strategy, leveraging the short training times and without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Following its application to a novel reactor concept, this work investigates the performance of Shallow Recurrent Decoders when applied to a real system. The underlying model is represented by a fluid dynamics model of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor; the architecture will use both synthetic temperature data coming from the numerical model and leveraging experimental temperature data recorded during a previous campaign. The objective of this work is, therefore, two-fold: 1) assessing if the architecture can reconstruct the full state of the system (temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulence quantities) given sparse data located in specific, low-dynamics channels and 2) assessing the correction capabilities of the architecture (that is, given a discrepancy between model and data, assessing if sparse measurements can provide some correction to the architecture output). As will be shown, the accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field, using both synthetic and experimental data, in real-time makes this approach suitable for interpretable monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</p></details> | 40 pages, 17 figures |

In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We starting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid bilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and thermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers. The most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system, describing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with phase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using trace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability in representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine physical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The computational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against experimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors, demonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics is essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in epi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate external forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic lipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.</p></details> |  |

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior.

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers high-fidelity predictions, its computational cost limits its use in iterative design. Equivalent Mechanical Models (EMMs) provide a faster alternative, though their predictive performance, especially in closed-loop scenarios, remains largely unexplored. This work presents a comparative analysis of a spacecraft under feedback control, using both CFD and a reduced-order sloshing model. Results show good agreement, validating the simplified model for the manoeuvrer considered. This validation enables efficient sensitivity and stability studies, offering a practical tool for early-stage spacecraft design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update after NIPS suggestions</p></details> |

The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Performance of a high-order MPI-Kokkos accelerated fluid solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05254v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work discusses the performance of a modern numerical scheme for fluid dynamical problems on modern high-performance computing architectures. Our code implements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an order of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta methods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations as well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In order to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units and accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in conjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on various GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code. Eighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing time than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller impact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to generally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs. The many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed up to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size simulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over CPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\approx 3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical simulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large grid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency that the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use it efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need longer computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the energy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 16 figures. submitted to Computer Physics Communications</p></details> |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03699v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.</p></details> |  |

We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition. Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</p></details> |  |

This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt.

Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM).

Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |

When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The first-order optimality condition for a state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space reduction.</p></details> | 25 pages |

They have high Columbic efficiency and minimal heat and emission footprints. However, improper use of LIBs, accidents, or other factors may increase the probability of thermal runaway (TR), a rapid combustion reaction that discharges toxic and flammable substances. Several such incidents have been documented in mines. Since repeatable TR experiments to uncover the transient-state propagation of TR are expensive and hazardous, high-fidelity models are usually developed to mimic the impact of these events. They are resource-intensive and are impractical to develop for many scenarios that could be observed in a mine. Therefore, dynamic models within a reduced-order framework were constructed to represent the transient-state combustion event. Reduced order models (ROMs) reasonably replicate trends in temperature and smoke, showing strong alignment with the ground-truth dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiLevel Variational MultiScale (ML-VMS) framework for large-scale simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23004v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the MultiLevel Variational MultiScale (ML-VMS) method, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates a multilevel mesh strategy into the Variational Multiscale (VMS) framework. A key feature of the ML-VMS method is the use of the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) as the approximation basis. The framework employs a coarse mesh throughout the domain, with localized fine meshes placed only in subdomains of high interest, such as those surrounding a source. Solutions at different resolutions are robustly coupled through the variational weak form and interface conditions. Compared to existing multilevel methods, ML-VMS (1) can couple an arbitrary number of mesh levels across different scales using variational multiscale framework; (2) allows approximating functions with arbitrary orders with linear finite element mesh due to the C-HiDeNN basis; (3) is supported by a rigorous theoretical error analysis; (4) features several tunable hyperparameters (e.g., order $p$, patch size $s$) with a systematic guide for their selection. We first show the theoretical error estimates of ML-VMS. Then through numerical examples, we demonstrate that ML-VMS with the C-HiDeNN takes less computational time than the FEM basis given comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a space-time reduced-order model (ROM) based on C-HiDeNN-Tensor Decomposition (TD) into the ML-VMS framework. For a large-scale single-track laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) transient heat transfer problem that is equivalent to a full-order finite element model with $10^{10}$ spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), our 3-level ML-VMS C-HiDeNN-TD achieves an approximately 5,000x speedup on a single CPU over a single-level linear FEM-TD ROM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Reduced Order Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs via Differentiable Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14595v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics. Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across various PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation that is readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers, available at https://phi-rom.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preconditioning and Reduced-Order Modeling of Navier-Stokes Equations in Complex Porous Microstructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22077v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations within the complex microstructure of a porous material. Discretizing the equations on a fine grid using a staggered (e.g., marker-and-cell, mixed FEM) scheme results in a nonlinear residual. Adopting the Newton method, a linear system must be solved at each iteration, which is large, ill-conditioned, and has a saddle-point structure. This demands an iterative (e.g., Krylov) solver, that requires preconditioning to ensure rapid convergence. We propose two monolithic \textit{algebraic} preconditioners, $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{NS}}$, that are generalizations of previously proposed forms by the authors for the Stokes equations ($a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{S}}$). The former is based on the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and the latter on the pore network model (PNM), both successful approximate solvers. We also formulate faster-converging geometric preconditioners $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ and $g\mathrm{PNM}$, which impose $\partial_n\boldsymbol{u}\!=\!0$ (zero normal-gradient of velocity) exactly at subdomain interfaces. Finally, we propose an accurate coarse-scale solver for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations based on $g\mathrm{PLMM}$, capable of computing approximate solutions orders of magnitude faster. We benchmark our preconditioners against state-of-the-art block preconditioners and show $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ is the best-performing one, followed closely by $a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ for steady-state flow and $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ for transient flow. All preconditioners can be built and applied on parallel machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A discrete physics-informed training for projection-based reduced order models with neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13875v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a physics-informed training framework for projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs). We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p></details> |  |
| **[House Thermal Model Estimation: Robustness Across Seasons and Setpoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21044v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving the flexibility from house heating, cooling, and ventilation systems (HVAC) has the potential to enable large-scale demand response by aggregating HVAC load adjustments across many homes. This demand response strategy helps distribution grid to flexibly ramp-up or ramp-down local load demand so that it can optimally match the bulk power system generation profile. However, achieving this capability requires house thermal models that are both computationally efficient and robust to operating conditions. In this work, parameters of the Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network thermal model for houses are estimated using three optimization algorithms: Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), Batch Estimation (BE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The resulting models are evaluated through a Forward-Simulation across four different seasons and three setpoints. The results illustrate a principled way of selecting reduced order models and estimation methods with respect to the robustness offered to seasonal and setpoint variations in training-testing datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a version of our paper accepted at the 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

We utilize this framework to parameterize the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile phase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation analytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate synthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary conditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of advection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of required forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a reduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the advection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the synthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by Projected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against several alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global random optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using nearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to 295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers accurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers to link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics, and measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the analysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional forward simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Water Resources Research</p></details> |

To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regul...</summary><p>Regular research article, 28 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields. We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving performance estimation of a PCM-integrated solar chimney through reduced-order based data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16469v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM) integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and 203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.</p></details> |  |

The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |

In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |

Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Partial Differential Equations on Parameter-Dependent Domains Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17171v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or the solution of the equations over multiple parameters. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, reduced order models (ROMs) are built using a set of precomputed solutions (snapshots) corresponding to different parameter values. Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM, offering improved flexibility and performance. In many cases, the domain on which the PDE is defined also varies. Capturing this variation is important for building accurate ROMs but is often difficult, especially when the domain has a complex structure or changes topology. In this paper, we propose a Deep-ROM framework that can automatically extract useful domain parametrization and incorporate it into the model. Unlike traditional domain parameterization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. It can also learn from domain data even when no mesh is available. Using deep autoencoders, our approach reduces the dimensionality of both the PDE solution and the domain representation, making it possible to approximate solutions efficiently across a wide range of domain shapes and parameter values. We demonstrate that our approach produces parametrizations that yield solution accuracy comparable to models using exact parameters. Importantly, our model remains stable under moderate geometric variations in the domain, such as boundary deformations and noise - scenarios where traditional ROMs often require remeshing or manual adjustment.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Statistical reduced order modelling for the parametric Helmholtz equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04438v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, associated code available at https://github.com/herluc/statROM.

We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.</p></details> |  |

In the context of damage detection, parametric reduced order models (ROMs) are well suited for fast computations by establishing an efficient offline/online split of the simulation process. The problems of interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and efficient reduction with low online cost. We demonstrate the applicability of the ROM approach with benchmark tests on linear elastic problems discretized with splines and the extended isogeometric method (XIGA) for crack modelling. The results we obtain show the accuracy and real-time efficiency of the constructed reduced order models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounds of Validity for Bifurcations of Equilibria in a Class of Networked Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10215v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local bifurcation analysis plays a central role in understanding qualitative transitions in networked nonlinear dynamical systems, including dynamic neural network and opinion dynamics models. In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference taking place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in May 2026</p></details> |

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport. GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, First authors contributed equally</p></details> |

This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology optimization of nonlinear forced response curves via reduction on spectral submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07900v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forced response curves (FRCs) of nonlinear systems can exhibit complex behaviors, including hardening/softening behavior and bifurcations. Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the topology optimization of structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures.

This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics. To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation, demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code https://github.com/dcherenson/adaptive-control-underactuated</p></details> |

Specifically, we investigate how machine learning can be employed to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model, both at the Full Order Model (FOM) and Reduced Order Model (ROM) levels. We explore a novel integration of these two areas. We generate the FOM snapshots, essential for ROM construction, using a data-driven RANS model: the $\nu_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This is the first time that these machine learning procedure generalizes a large parametric variation, and we propose tailored training strategies to increase the accuracy of the FOM model. At the ROM level, we compare the results obtained by standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition in an intrusive Galerkin setting (PODG) and POD Neural Network approach (PODNN). The numerical validation is based on a classic turbulent flow benchmark: the flow in a square duct. Our investigation reveals that the PODG method, proves unstable and inaccurate for turbulent flow prediction, while PODNN demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each, derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

| **[From Shadow to Light: Toward Safe and Efficient Policy Learning Across MPC, DeePC, RL, and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04076v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances, data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique, such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft robots, and vehicle motion control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential decoder training for improved latent space dynamics identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03535v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGRDN-Data learned sparsification of graph reaction-diffusion networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11943v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph sparsification is an area of interest in computer science and applied mathematics. Sparsification of a graph, in general, aims to reduce the number of edges in the network while preserving specific properties of the graph, like cuts and subgraph counts. Computing the sparsest cuts of a graph is known to be NP-hard, and sparsification routines exist for generating linear-sized sparsifiers in almost quadratic running time $O(n^{2 + \epsilon})$. Consequently, obtaining a sparsifier can be a computationally demanding task, and the complexity varies based on the level of sparsity required. We propose SGRDN to extend sparsification to complex reaction-diffusion systems. This approach seeks to sparsify the graph such that the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics are strictly preserved on the resulting structure. By selectively considering a subset of trajectories, we frame the network sparsification issue as a data assimilation problem within a Reduced Order Model (ROM) space, imposing constraints to conserve the eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix ($L = D - A$), the difference between the degree matrix ($D$) and the adjacency matrix ($A$) despite perturbations. We derive computationally efficient eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations for perturbed Laplacian matrices and integrate these as spectral preservation constraints in the optimization problem. To further validate the method's broad applicability, we conducted an additional experiment on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs), where SGRDN successfully achieved parameter sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[oRANS: Online optimisation of RANS machine learning models with embedded DNS data generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02982v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains. Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes without requiring large precomputed training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for deployment in operational systems or for training with computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators -- such as reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or generative world models -- can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a control variate formed from a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. We show that under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence of REINFORCE to locally optimal policies in the target environment, and achieves faster finite-sample convergence rates compared to training with high-fidelity data alone. Empirically, we evaluate the MFPG algorithm across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. With mild-moderate dynamics gaps, MFPG reliably improves the median performance over a high-fidelity-only baseline, matching the performance of leading multi-fidelity baselines despite its simplicity and minimal tuning overhead. Under large dynamics gaps, MFPG demonstrates the strongest robustness among the evaluated multi-fidelity approaches. An additional experiment shows that MFPG can remain effective even under low-fidelity reward misspecification. Thus, MFPG not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Control via Recurrent Tracking Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01147v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs), which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control $\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs' effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.</p></details> | 7 Pages, 2 Figures |
| **[Deep Learning for Subspace Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23249v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive CUR Algorithm and its Application to Reduced-Order Modeling of Random PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21480v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Certain classes of CUR algorithms, also referred to as cross or pseudoskeleton algorithms, are widely used for low-rank matrix approximation when direct access to all matrix entries is costly. Their key advantage lies in constructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of the target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for reduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where nonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or even full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$. CUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the rank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of accuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability. In this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the intersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error analysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We also present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling entries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several nonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology as a fast, reliable tool for real-time process monitoring and optimization in industrial continuous casting operations.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new adaptive strategy for linear ROM that allows the reduced mapping to vary dynamically in response to the evolving deformation state, significantly improving accuracy over traditional linear approaches. To further handle large deformations, we introduce a historical displacement basis combined with Grassmann interpolation, enabling the system to recover robustly even in challenging scenarios. We evaluate our method through quantitative online-error analysis and qualitative comparisons with principal component analysis (PCA)-based linear ROM simulations, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains while preserving comparable computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Frequency Reduced-Basis method: Reduced order models for time-dependent problems using the Laplace transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19120v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a reduced basis method to solve time-dependent partial differential equations based on the Laplace transform. Unlike traditional approaches, we start by applying said transform to the evolution problem, yielding a time-independent boundary value problem that depends on the complex Laplace parameter. First, in an offline stage, we appropriately sample the Laplace parameter and solve the collection of problems using the finite element method. Next, we apply a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to this collection of solutions in order to obtain a reduced basis that is of dimension much smaller than that of the original solution space. This reduced basis, in turn, is then used to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. A key insight to justify the formulation of the method resorts to Hardy spaces of analytic functions. By applying the widely-known Paley-Wiener theorem we can then define an isometry between the solution of the time-dependent problem and its Laplace transform. As a consequence of this result, one may conclude that computing a POD with samples taken in the Laplace domain produces an exponentially accurate reduced basis for the time-dependent problem. Numerical experiments characterizing the performance of the method, in terms of accuracy and speed-up, are included for a variety of relevant time-evolution equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating High-Fidelity Fixed Point Schemes with On-the-fly Reduced Order Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22846v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A general method for accelerating fixed point schemes for problems related to partial differential equations is presented in this article. The speedup is obtained by training a reduced-order model on-the-fly, removing the need to do an offline training phase and any dependence to a precomputed reduced basis (e.g. a fixed geometry or mesh). The surrogate model can adapt itself along the iterations because of an error criterion based on error propagation, ensuring the high fidelity of the converged result. Convergence results are given for a general class of fixed point problems with complex dependence structures between multiple auxiliary linear systems. The proposed algorithm is applied to the solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations. The speedups obtained are significant, and the output of the method can be considered high-fidelity when compared to the reference solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenUQ: Predictive Uncertainty Estimates via Generative Hyper-Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21605v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</p></details> |  |

A human-inspired paradigm was designed for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |

In the first stage, a compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates. In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Computational Science Graduate Project</p></details> |
| **[Physically consistent predictive reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03672v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |

| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven balanced truncation for linear systems with quadratic outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12393v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the framework for a non-intrusive, quadrature-based method for approximate balanced truncation (QuadBT) of linear systems with quadratic outputs, thus extending the applicability of QuadBT, which was originally designed for data-driven balanced truncation of standard linear systems with linear outputs only. The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system's infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. We validate the proposed framework on a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Chebyshev--Ritz Spectral Framework for Nonlinear Vibration of CNT-Reinforced Composite Beams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11946v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a spectral Ritz formulation for the nonlinear free vibration analysis of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) beams. Boundary-adapted Chebyshev basis functions are constructed to exactly satisfy clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The governing equations incorporate von~K\'{a}rm\'{a}n geometric nonlinearity, while the effective material properties for both uniform and functionally graded (FG) CNT distributions are evaluated using a modified rule of mixtures. Discretization via the Chebyshev-Ritz approach produces a reduced-order model exhibiting exponential convergence; for basis sizes $N \geq 12$, the fundamental frequency error remains below $0.1\%$ relative to published benchmarks. Computational results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains, with the spectral approach requiring significantly less time than high-fidelity finite element discretizations of comparable accuracy. Parametric studies reveal that the fundamental frequency increases with CNT volume fraction and is sensitive to the interfacial load-transfer efficiency parameter $\eta_E$. Selected FG patterns are shown to enhance stiffness relative to uniformly distributed CNTs. Validation against established numerical benchmarks yields relative differences of only a few percent. The current limitation of the method is its reliance on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumption, which neglects transverse shear deformation and damping; addressing these effects is proposed for future work. All numerical data and scripts are provided as supplementary material to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language model-empowered next-generation computer-aided engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11447v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |

Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

Such systems are typically approximated with reduced-order models, which often rely on orthogonal projections, a simplification that may lead to large prediction errors. In this work, we derive optimality of fiber-aligned projections onto spectral submanifolds, preserving the nonlinear geometric structure and minimizing long-term prediction error. We propose a data-driven procedure to learn these projections from trajectories and demonstrate its effectiveness through a 180-dimensional robotic system. Our reduced-order models achieve up to fivefold improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters. To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive. These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v4)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |

Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-field decomposed hyper-reduced order modeling of damage-plasticity simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19957v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a multi-field decomposed approach for hyper-reduced order modeling to overcome the limitations of traditional model reduction techniques for gradient-extended damage-plasticity simulations. The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling instability in the Vlasov-Poisson system through moment-based optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18412v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling instability in plasma is one of the central challenges in fusion energy research. Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally, moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizations of data-driven balancing: What to sample for different balancing-based reduced models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12561v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadrature-based balanced truncation (QuadBT) framework of arXiv:2104.01006 is a non-intrusive reformulation of balanced truncation (BT), a classical projection-based model-order reduction technique for linear systems. QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

This success has motivated efforts to apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability. Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.</p></details> |  |

This numerical method uses a cubic interpolation of the states and the action is approximated at each time step by Lobatto's formula. Numerical analysis is performed on both a harmonic oscillator and a nonlinear pendulum. The geometric scheme is conditionally stable, sixth-order accurate, and symplectic. It preserves an approximate energy quantity. Simulation results illustrate the performance and the superconvergence of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Physics-Embedded Learning for Spatiotemporal Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25306v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity, characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators, we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without presupposing functional forms.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaM-SLidE: Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12128v4)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are spearheading recent progress in deep learning, showcasing strong promise for trajectory sampling in dynamical systems as well. However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

| **[Privacy Preservation by Local Design in Cooperative Networked Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03904v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the privacy preservation problem in a cooperative networked control system, which has closed-loop dynamics, working for the task of linear quadratic Guassian (LQG) control. The system consists of a user and a server: the user owns the plant to control, while the server provides computation capability, and the user employs the server to compute control inputs for it. To enable the server's computation, the user needs to provide the measurements of the plant states to the server, who then calculates estimates of the states, based on which the control inputs are computed. However, the user regards the states as privacy, and makes an interesting request: the user wants the server to have "incorrect" knowledge of the state estimates rather than the true values. Regarding that, we propose a novel design methodology for the privacy preservation, in which the privacy scheme is locally equipped at the user side not open to the server, which manages to create a deviation in the server's knowledge of the state estimates from the true values. However, this methodology also raises significant challenges: in a closed-loop dynamic system, when the server's seized knowledge is incorrect, the system's behavior becomes complex to analyze; even the stability of the system becomes questionable, as the incorrectness will accumulate through the closed loop as time evolves. In this paper, we succeed in showing that the performance loss in LQG control caused by the proposed privacy scheme is bounded by rigorous mathematical proofs, which convinces the availability of the proposed design methodology. We also propose an associated novel privacy metric and obtain the analytical result on evaluating the privacy performance. Finally, we study the performance trade-off between privacy and control, where the accordingly proposed optimization problems are solved by numerical methods efficiently.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
