| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) offers an interpretable alternative to conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, which are often criticized as ``black boxes''. In contrast to standard regression models that require a prescribed functional form, SR constructs expressions from a user-defined set of mathematical primitives, enabling the automated discovery of compact formulas that fit the data and reveal underlying physical relationships. In fluid mechanics, where understanding the underlying physics is as crucial as predictive accuracy, this study applies SR to model three-dimensional (3D) laminar flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the axial velocity and pressure fields. Compact symbolic equations were derived from numerical simulation data, accurately reproducing the expected parabolic velocity profile and linear pressure drop, and showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions from the literature. To address the limitation that purely data-driven SR models may overlook domain-specific constraints, an innovative hybrid framework that integrates SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is also introduced. This integration combines the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning capabilities of ASP, ensuring that derived equations remain both statistically accurate and physically plausible. The proposed SR/ASP methodology demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-representation approaches to enhance interpretability, reliability, and alignment with physical principles in fluid dynamics and related domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |
| **[Indoor Fluid Antenna Systems Enabled by Layout-Specific Modeling and Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15006v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna system (FAS) revolutionizes wireless communications via utilizing position-flexible antennas that dynamically optimize channel conditions and mitigate multipath fading. This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures;</p></details> |
| **[FunDiff: Diffusion Models over Function Spaces for Physics-Informed Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07902v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/sifanexisted/fundiff.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19390v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04898v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh-Quantization for Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18474v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDBench: Benchmarking Data-Driven Methods for Model Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20529v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems: An Extreme Value Theory Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17916v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna systems (FAS) allow dynamic reconfiguration to achieve superior diversity gains and reliability. To quantify the performance scaling of FAS with a large number of antenna ports, this paper leverages extreme value theory (EVT) to conduct an asymptotic analysis of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC). The analysis reveals that the OP decays approximately exponentially with the number of antenna ports. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic EC, uncovering its double-logarithmic scaling law. Furthermore, we re-substantiate these scaling laws by exploiting the fact that the mode of the Gumbel distribution scales logarithmically. Besides, we theoretically prove that spatial correlation among antenna ports degrades both OP and EC. All analytical findings are conclusively validated by numerical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Birkhoff Averages Accelerate Data-Driven Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17772v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Niño data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomness as Reference: Benchmark Metric for Optimization in Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17226v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking optimization algorithms is fundamental for the advancement of computational intelligence. However, widely adopted artificial test suites exhibit limited correspondence with the diversity and complexity of real-world engineering optimization tasks. This paper presents a new benchmark suite comprising 231 bounded, continuous, unconstrained optimization problems, the majority derived from engineering design and simulation scenarios, including computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis models. In conjunction with this suite, a novel performance metric is introduced, which employs random sampling as a statistical reference, providing nonlinear normalization of objective values and enabling unbiased comparison of algorithmic efficiency across heterogeneous problems. Using this framework, 20 deterministic and stochastic optimization methods were systematically evaluated through hundreds of independent runs per problem, ensuring statistical robustness. The results indicate that only a few of the tested optimization methods consistently achieve excellent performance, while several commonly used metaheuristics exhibit severe efficiency loss on engineering-type problems, emphasizing the limitations of conventional benchmarks. Furthermore, the conducted tests are used for analyzing various features of the optimization methods, providing practical guidelines for their application. The proposed test suite and metric together offer a transparent, reproducible, and practically relevant platform for evaluating and comparing optimization methods, thereby narrowing the gap between the available benchmark tests and realistic engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment. This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale. On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence. This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Uncertainty via Automation: Observing, Analyzing, and Optimizing Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11277v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems - collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges. This paper presents our vision of AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles - developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users - each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems - not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Green Distributed AI Training: Orchestrating Compute Across Renewable-Powered Micro Datacenters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16182v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accelerating expansion of AI workloads is colliding with an energy landscape increasingly dominated by intermittent renewable generation. While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration. At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies. Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a paper submitted - v01 November 2025</p></details> |

Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (FRIS) Enabling Secure Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15860v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).</p></details> |  |
| **[Walrus: A Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Continuum Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15684v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have transformed machine learning for language and vision, but achieving comparable impact in physical simulation remains a challenge. Data heterogeneity and unstable long-term dynamics inhibit learning from sufficiently diverse dynamics, while varying resolutions and dimensionalities challenge efficient training on modern hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we incorporate new approaches to mitigate these obstacles, including a harmonic-analysis-based stabilization method, load-balanced distributed 2D and 3D training strategies, and compute-adaptive tokenization. Using these tools, we develop Walrus, a transformer-based foundation model developed primarily for fluid-like continuum dynamics. Walrus is pretrained on nineteen diverse scenarios spanning astrophysics, geoscience, rheology, plasma physics, acoustics, and classical fluids. Experiments show that Walrus outperforms prior foundation models on both short and long term prediction horizons on downstream tasks and across the breadth of pretraining data, while ablation studies confirm the value of our contributions to forecast stability, training throughput, and transfer performance over conventional approaches. Code and weights are released for community use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turb-L1: Achieving Long-term Turbulence Tracing By Tackling Spectral Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19038v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications. However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Graph Rewiring to Mitigate Over-Squashing in Mesh-Based GNNs for Fluid Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12709v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |

| **[Aligning LLMs Toward Multi-Turn Conversational Outcomes Using Iterative PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21638v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01695v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visualizing LLM Latent Space Geometry Through Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21594v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research. We make our code available at https://github.com/Vainateya/Feature_Geometry_Visualization.</p></details> | 24 pages, 16 figures |
| **[TinyChemVL: Advancing Chemical Vision-Language Models via Efficient Visual Token Reduction and Complex Reaction Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06283v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general visual understanding, their application in the chemical domain has been limited, with previous works predominantly focusing on text and thus overlooking critical visual information, such as molecular structures. Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens. This work builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains by co-designing model architecture and task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling and Optimizing Performance Bottlenecks for Neuromorphic Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21549v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic accelerators offer promising platforms for machine learning (ML) inference by leveraging event-driven, spatially-expanded architectures that naturally exploit unstructured sparsity through co-located memory and compute. However, their unique architectural characteristics create performance dynamics that differ fundamentally from conventional accelerators. Existing workload optimization approaches for neuromorphic accelerators rely on aggregate network-wide sparsity and operation counting, but the extent to which these metrics actually improve deployed performance remains unknown. This paper presents the first comprehensive performance bound and bottleneck analysis of neuromorphic accelerators, revealing the shortcomings of the conventional metrics and offering an understanding of what facets matter for workload performance. We present both theoretical analytical modeling and extensive empirical characterization of three real neuromorphic accelerators: Brainchip AKD1000, Synsense Speck, and Intel Loihi 2. From these, we establish three distinct accelerator bottleneck states, memory-bound, compute-bound, and traffic-bound, and identify which workload configuration features are likely to exhibit these bottleneck states. We synthesize all of our insights into the floorline performance model, a visual model that identifies performance bounds and informs how to optimize a given workload, based on its position on the model. Finally, we present an optimization methodology that combines sparsity-aware training with floorline-informed partitioning. Our methodology achieves substantial performance improvements at iso-accuracy: up to 3.86x runtime improvement and 3.38x energy reduction compared to prior manually-tuned configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntAttention: A Fully Integer Attention Pipeline for Efficient Edge Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21513v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[DensiCrafter: Physically-Constrained Generation and Fabrication of Self-Supporting Hollow Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09298v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonoMPC: Monocular Vision Based Navigation with Learned Collision Model and Risk-Aware Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07387v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating unknown environments with a single RGB camera is challenging, as the lack of depth information prevents reliable collision-checking. While some methods use estimated depth to build collision maps, we found that depth estimates from vision foundation models are too noisy for zero-shot navigation in cluttered environments. We propose an alternative approach: instead of using noisy estimated depth for direct collision-checking, we use it as a rich context input to a learned collision model. This model predicts the distribution of minimum obstacle clearance that the robot can expect for a given control sequence. At inference, these predictions inform a risk-aware MPC planner that minimizes estimated collision risk. We proposed a joint learning pipeline that co-trains the collision model and risk metric using both safe and unsafe trajectories. Crucially, our joint-training ensures well calibrated uncertainty in our collision model that improves navigation in highly cluttered environments. Consequently, real-world experiments show reductions in collision-rate and improvements in goal reaching and speed over several strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable multimodal embedding, existing methods treat representations as black boxes, ignoring structural relationships (e.g., primary vs. auxiliary elements), leading to local structural collapse problem. To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS. Deployed on Meituan's advertising system, FITRep achieves +3.60% CTR and +4.25% CPM gains in online A/B tests, demonstrating both effectiveness and real-world impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation rates of quantum neural networks for periodic functions via Jackson's inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16149v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.</p></details> |  |

While machine unlearning techniques can remove backdoor behaviors, current methods lack transparency and real-time interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) into the unlearning process to provide real-time monitoring and explainability. We propose the Trigger Attention Ratio (TAR) metric to quantitatively measure the model's attention shift from trigger patterns to legitimate object features. Our balanced unlearning strategy combines gradient ascent on backdoor samples, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for catastrophic forgetting prevention, and a recovery phase for clean accuracy restoration. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with BadNets attacks demonstrate that our approach reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 96.51% to 5.52% while retaining 99.48% of clean accuracy (82.06%), achieving a 94.28% ASR reduction. The integration of explainable AI enables transparent, observable, and verifiable backdoor removal.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, IEEE conference format</p></details> |

The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).</p></details> |  |

While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18866v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. On LongMemEval and LoCoMo, using GPT and Qwen backbones, LightMem consistently surpasses strong baselines, improving QA accuracy by up to 7.7% / 29.3%, reducing total token usage by up to 38x / 20.9x and API calls by up to 30x / 55.5x, while purely online test-time costs are even lower, achieving up to 106x / 117x token reduction and 159x / 310x fewer API calls. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.</p></details> | Work in progress |

By embedding protein structural data into a topological framework, we extract multiscale features from filtered simplicial complexes constructed over atomic coordinates. These topological invariants, specifically persistence diagrams and barcodes, capture critical geometric and connectivity patterns that correlate with motor function. The extracted features are vectorized and integrated into a machine learning pipeline that includes dimensionality reduction and supervised classification. Applied to a curated dataset of experimentally characterized flagellar motors from diverse bacterial species, our model demonstrates high classification accuracy and robustness to structural variation. This approach highlights the power of topological data analysis in revealing functionally relevant patterns beyond the reach of traditional geometric descriptors, offering a novel computational tool for protein function prediction.</p></details> |  |

While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/changlin31/Ent-Prog</p></details> |

This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[MLPMoE: Zero-Shot Architectural Metamorphosis of Dense LLM MLPs into Static Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21089v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Vision Transformer Learning Leveraging Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20983v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Navigating Quantum Missteps in Agent-Based Modeling: A Schelling Model Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15642v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from "simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence" to "compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activator: GLU Activation Function as the Core Component of a Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15953v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformer architecture has driven many successes in a variety of tasks within the field of deep learning, in particular the recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) culminating with large language models (LLM). Adding to that success, transformer architecture has found widespread interest from computer vision (CV) researchers and practitioners, allowing for many advancements in vision-related tasks and opening the door for multitask and multi-modal deep learning architectures that share the same principle of operation. One drawback to these architectures is their reliance on the scaled dot product attention mechanism with the softmax activation function, which is computationally expensive and requires large compute capabilities for both training and inference. This paper investigates substituting the MLP and attention mechanism usually adopted for transformer architecture with an architecture based on incorporating a gated linear unit (GLU) activation function structure with the aim of reducing the computational cost. The equalized experimental assessments conducted in this work show that the proposed modification with the targeted reductions in computational complexity offers competitive performance compared to the selected baseline architectures. The results are significantly in support of the aims of this work, in which the focus was to extensively utilize GLU-based MLPs, establishing a more efficient but capable alternative to the traditional MLP and the attention mechanism as the core component in the design of transformer architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20849v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operationalizing Pluralistic Values in Large Language Model Alignment Reveals Trade-offs in Safety, Inclusivity, and Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14476v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collect alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095 participants, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% higher on EA than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?</p></details> |  |
| **[RefTr: Recurrent Refinement of Confluent Trajectories for 3D Vascular Tree Centerline Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20823v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

However, important challenges remain regarding scalability, interpretability, and the availability of reliable datasets. This paper brings together six related studies that collectively address these issues. The portfolio begins with a survey of graph-based malware detection and explainability, then advances to new graph reduction methods, integrated reduction-learning approaches, and investigations into the consistency of explanations. It also introduces dual explanation techniques based on subgraph matching and develops ensemble-based models with attention-guided stacked GNNs to improve interpretability. In parallel, curated datasets of control flow graphs are released to support reproducibility and enable future research.

| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling the Spread of Toxicity and Exploring its Mitigation on Online Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20546v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hate speech on online platforms has been credibly linked to multiple instances of real world violence. This calls for an urgent need to understand how toxic content spreads and how it might be mitigated on online social networks, and expectedly has been the topic of extensive research in recent times. Prior work has largely modelled hate through epidemic or spread activation based diffusion models, in which the users are often divided into two categories, hateful or not. In this work, users are treated as transformers of toxicity, based on how they respond to incoming toxicity. Compared with the incoming toxicity, users amplify, attenuate, or replicate (effectively, transform) the toxicity and send it forward. We do a temporal analysis of toxicity on Twitter, Koo and Gab and find that (a) toxicity is not conserved in the network; (b) only a subset of users change behaviour over time; and (c) there is no evidence of homophily among behaviour-changing users. In our model, each user transforms incoming toxicity by applying a "shift" to it prior to sending it forward. Based on this, we develop a network model of toxicity spread that incorporates time-varying behaviour of users. We find that the "shift" applied by a user is dependent on the input toxicity and the category. Based on this finding, we propose an intervention strategy for toxicity reduction. This is simulated by deploying peace-bots. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks, we demonstrate that peace-bot interventions can reduce toxicity, though their effectiveness depends on network structure and placement strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature-Modulated UFNO for Improved Prediction of Multiphase Flow in Porous Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20543v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway, enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21\% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power-Efficient Autonomous Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20467v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents pNav, a novel power-management system that significantly enhances the power/energy-efficiency of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) by jointly optimizing their physical/mechanical and cyber subsystems. By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a >96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |
| **[A Task-Oriented Evaluation Framework for Text Normalization in Modern NLP Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20409v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).</p></details> |  |
| **[AD-R1: Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Impartial World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20325v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Language Agents through BREW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20297v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder Guided Feature Selection for IoT Intrusion Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15511v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) benefit from the diversity and generalization of IoT data features, the data diversity (e.g., the heterogeneity and high dimensions of data) also makes it difficult to train effective machine learning models in IoT IDSs. This also leads to potentially redundant/noisy features that may decrease the accuracy of the detection engine in IDSs. This paper first introduces a novel neural network architecture called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder (MIAE). MIAE consists of multiple sub-encoders that can process inputs from different sources with different characteristics. The MIAE model is trained in an unsupervised learning mode to transform the heterogeneous inputs into lower-dimensional representation, which helps classifiers distinguish between normal behaviour and different types of attacks. To distil and retain more relevant features but remove less important/redundant ones during the training process, we further design and embed a feature selection layer right after the representation layer of MIAE resulting in a new model called MIAEFS. This layer learns the importance of features in the representation vector, facilitating the selection of informative features from the representation vector. The results on three IDS datasets, i.e., NSLKDD, UNSW-NB15, and IDS2017, show the superior performance of MIAE and MIAEFS compared to other methods, e.g., conventional classifiers, dimensionality reduction models, unsupervised representation learning methods with different input dimensions, and unsupervised feature selection models. Moreover, MIAE and MIAEFS combined with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieve accuracy of 96.5% in detecting sophisticated attacks, e.g., Slowloris. The average running time for detecting an attack sample using RF with the representation of MIAE and MIAEFS is approximate 1.7E-6 seconds, whilst the model size is lower than 1 MB.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniAlpha: A Sequence-to-Sequence Framework for Unified Multi-Task RGBA Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20211v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have excelled in RGB synthesis, but real-world applications require RGBA manipulation. This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beluga: A CXL-Based Memory Architecture for Scalable and Efficient LLM KVCache Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20172v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by SIGMOD'26</p></details> |
| **[SuperQuadricOcc: Multi-Layer Gaussian Approximation of Superquadrics for Real-Time Self-Supervised Occupancy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17361v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75% reduction in memory footprint, 124% faster inference, and a 5.9% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be made available at https://github.com/seamie6/SuperQuadricOcc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Guiding Multi-Scale Adaptive Sparse Representation-driven Network for Low-Dose CT MAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19687v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose CT (LDCT) is capable of reducing X-ray radiation exposure, but it will potentially degrade image quality, even yields metal artifacts at the case of metallic implants. For simultaneous LDCT reconstruction and metal artifact reduction (LDMAR), existing deep learning-based efforts face two main limitations: i) the network design neglects multi-scale and within-scale information; ii) training a distinct model for each dose necessitates significant storage space for multiple doses. To fill these gaps, we propose a prompt guiding multi-scale adaptive sparse representation-driven network, abbreviated as PMSRNet, for LDMAR task. Specifically, we construct PMSRNet inspired from multi-scale sparsifying frames, and it can simultaneously employ within-scale characteristics and cross-scale complementarity owing to an elaborated prompt guiding scale-adaptive threshold generator (PSATG) and a built multi-scale coefficient fusion module (MSFuM). The PSATG can adaptively capture multiple contextual information to generate more faithful thresholds, achieved by fusing features from local, regional, and global levels. Furthermore, we elaborate a model interpretable dual domain LDMAR framework called PDuMSRNet, and train single model with a prompt guiding strategy for multiple dose levels. We build a prompt guiding module, whose input contains dose level, metal mask and input instance, to provide various guiding information, allowing a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings. Extensive experiments at various dose levels demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[IDAP++: Advancing Divergence-Based Pruning via Filter-Level and Layer-Level Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20141v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 4 figures, 38 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimally Deep Networks -- Adapting Model Depth to Datasets for Superior Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10764v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training big and deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provides a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training neural networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the tasks at hand, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the model memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 2 equations, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for Scalable Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04032v6)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning-based personalized recommendation systems provide qualified recommendations, they strain data center resources. The main bottleneck is the embedding layer, which is highly memory-intensive due to its sparse, irregular access patterns to embeddings. Recent near-memory processing (NMP) and processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have addressed these issues by exploiting parallelism within memory. However, as model sizes increase year by year and can exceed server capacity, inference on single-node servers becomes challenging, necessitating the integration of model compression. Various algorithms have been proposed for model size reduction, but they come at the cost of increased memory access and CPU-PIM communication. We present ProactivePIM, a PIM system tailored for weight-sharing algorithms, a family of compression methods that decompose an embedding table into compact subtables, such as QR-trick and TT-Rec. Our analysis shows that embedding layer execution with weight-sharing algorithms increases memory access and incurs CPU-PIM communication. We also find that these algorithms exhibit unique data locality characteristics, which we name intra-GnR locality. ProactivePIM accelerates weight-sharing algorithms by utilizing a heterogeneous HBM-DIMM memory architecture with integration of a two-level PIM system of base-die PIM (bd-PIM) and bank-group PIM (bg-PIM) inside the HBM. To gain further speedup, ProactivePIM prefetches embeddings with high intra-GnR locality into an SRAM cache within bg-PIM and eliminates the CPU-PIM communication through duplication of target subtables across bank groups. With additional optimization techniques, our design effectively accelerates weight-sharing algorithms, achieving 2.22x and 2.15x speedup in QR-trick and TT-Rec, respectively, compared to the baseline architecture.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

In this paper, we propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework featuring a novel quantization format termed Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ is designed to better capture the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the computational cost of bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating dequantization overhead. HLQ is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms. For the LLaMA3.1-8B model, when combined with post-training quantization, HLQ improves uniform quantization by achieving approximately 8 percent perplexity reduction at 3-bit precision and 85 percent perplexity reduction at 2-bit precision. When combined with efficient finetuning techniques, HLQ further improves model accuracy. We also integrate a disk-offload technique into ELUTQ, enabling it to complete the quantization of LLaMA3.1-70B using only 64 GB of CPU memory and 48 GB of VRAM, significantly reducing the hardware requirements for large-scale model quantization. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, ELUTQ provides high-performance CPU kernels to support end-to-end inference. Under a 4-thread configuration with batch size 1, our 2-bit quantized LLaMA2-7B model achieves a throughput of more than 25 tokens per second on an Apple M2 chip. All the code is available at https://github.com/Nkniexin/ELUTQ.</p></details> | 28 pages, 10 figures |

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures;</p></details> |

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches suffer from limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2% IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%. Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers, IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.</p></details> |  |

We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Attention Pruning: Automated Fairness Repair of Language Models via Surrogate Simulated Annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15815v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores pruning attention heads as a post-processing bias mitigation method for large language models (LLMs). Modern AI systems such as LLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns become especially crucial. Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by training on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode and perpetuate societal biases. While modifying training datasets and algorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing techniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in pre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve fairness. However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune presents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space, requiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the frontiers of model fairness and utility. To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program repair approach via randomized simulated annealing. Given the prohibitive evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states (active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics. This allows us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly searching through the LLM parameter space. This paper introduces Attention Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while minimally impacting overall model utility. Our experiments show that Attention Pruning achieves up to $40\%$ reduction in gender bias and outperforms the state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

We answer this in the affirmative by exhibiting a simple two-step procedure: first uniquely decode $C_2$, then apply a single error/erasure decoding of $C_1$.This shows that the restrictive hypothesis $d_1\ge\tfrac{2}{3}d_{\mathrm{sr}}$ is theoretically unnecessary.The resulting decoder achieves unique decoding up to $\lfloor (d_{\mathrm{sr}}-1)/2\rfloor$ with overall cost $T_2+T_1$, where $T_2$ and $T_1$ are the complexities of the Hamming decoders for $C_2$ and $C_1$, respectively. We further show that this reduction is asymptotically optimal in a black-box model, as any sum-rank decoder must inherently decode the constituent Hamming codes.For BCH or Goppa instantiations over $\F_4$, the decoder runs in $O(\ell^2)$ time.</p></details> | 16 pages |

This study proposes a new feature, relative angle, computed as the angle between the normal vector of a point and the average normal vector of its parent point cloud. This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression. This novel feature has the potential to enable larger-batch execution on resource-constrained hardware without the necessity of architectural modifications to models.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Attention Spans: Optimizing LLM Inference Efficiency with Heterogeneous Sliding-Window Lengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14909v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sliding-window attention offers a hardware-efficient solution to the memory and throughput challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. Existing methods typically employ a single window length across all attention heads and input sizes. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the heterogeneous attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose *Mixture of Attention Spans* (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sliding-window length configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various window lengths and their scaling rules relative to input sizes. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal length configurations for each head. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer inputs, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by 3.9x with the same average sliding-window length, boosting retrieval accuracy by 1.5-7.1x over the uniform-window baseline across Vicuna-{7B, 13B} and Llama3-{8B, 70B} models. Moreover, MoA narrows the performance gap with full attention, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from 9%-36% to within 5% across three long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a 1.2-1.4x GPU memory reduction, boosting decode throughput by 6.6-8.2x and 1.7-1.9x over FlashAttention2 and vLLM, with minimal performance impact.

Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincaré recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games.</p></details> |  |

This has sparked significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally, we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support climate mitigation efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical article to be submitted to Data Centric Engineering Journal</p></details> |

A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the filtered finite state projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel consistent MP filter employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Coreset Selection via Iterative Subspace Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15349v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning increasingly relies on massive data with substantial storage, annotation, and training costs. To reduce costs, coreset selection finds a representative subset of data to train models while ideally performing on par with the full data training. To maximize performance, current state-of-the-art coreset methods select data using dataset-specific ground truth labels and training. However, these methodological requirements prevent selection at scale on real-world, unlabeled data. To that end, this paper addresses the selection of coresets that achieve state-of-the-art performance but without using any labels or training on candidate data. Instead, our solution, Zero-Shot Coreset Selection via Iterative Subspace Sampling (ZCore), uses previously-trained foundation models to generate zero-shot, high-dimensional embedding spaces to interpret unlabeled data. ZCore then iteratively quantifies the relative value of all candidate data based on coverage and redundancy in numerous subspace distributions. Finally, ZCore selects a coreset sized for any data budget to train downstream models. We evaluate ZCore on four datasets and outperform several state-of-the-art label-based methods, especially at low data rates that provide the most substantial cost reduction. On ImageNet, ZCore selections for 10% training data achieve a downstream validation accuracy of 53.99%, which outperforms prior label-based methods and removes annotation and training costs for 1.15 million images. Our paper's code is publicly available at https://github.com/voxel51/zcore.</p></details> | WACV 2026 |

Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\% energy reduction with 2-3\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stone Duality Proofs for Colorless Distributed Computability Theorems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03609v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new topological encoding of executions of round-based, full-information distributed protocols via spectral spaces. Such protocols constitute a model of distributed computations which are functorially presented and englobe message adversaries. We give a characterization of the solvability of colorless tasks against compact adversaries. Colorless tasks are an important class of distributed tasks, examples thereof including the ubiquitous agreement tasks. Therefore, our result is a significant step toward unifying topological methods in distributed computing. The main insight of this work is in considering global states obtained after finite executions of a distributed protocol not as abstract simplicial complexes as was previously done, but as spectral spaces, considering the Alexandrov topology on the associated face posets. Given an adversary $\mathcal{M}$ with a set of inputs $\mathcal{I}$, we define a limit object $Π^\infty_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{I})$ by a projective limit in the category of spectral spaces. This encodes all distributed information about the adversary, allowing us to derive a new distributed computability theorem using Stone duality: there exists an algorithm solving a colorless task $(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{O},Δ)$ against the compact adversary $\mathcal{M}$ if and only if there exists a spectral map $Π^\infty_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{I})\rightarrow\mathcal{O}$ compatible with $Δ$. From this characterization, we derive the known colorless computability theorems for (colored or uncolored) Iterated Immediate Snapshot. Quite surprisingly, colored and uncolored models have the same distributed computability power, i.e. they solve the same tasks. Our new proofs give topological reasons for this equivalence, previously known through algorithmic reductions.</p></details> |  |

For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE conference on Big Data (Special Session on Machine Learning)</p></details> |

However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language (i.e., concise outputs that retain essential meaning) when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which the LLM omits a predefined set of semantically irrelevant and easily inferable words based on the context during inference. Then, a specifically trained smaller language model with lower inference cost reconstructs the distilled answer into the ideal answer. Our experiments show promising results, particularly on the proposed NaLDA evaluation dataset focused on the reconstruction task, with 19.4% saved tokens on average for GPT-4o and only a tiny decrease in evaluation metrics. This suggests that the approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations. To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones. On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

While edge-based MPNNs effectively capture local interactions, their expressive power is theoretically bounded, limiting the discovery of higher-order relationships. We introduce the Higher-Order Graph Attention (HoGA) module, which constructs a k-order attention matrix by sampling subgraphs to maximize diversity among feature vectors. Unlike existing higher-order attention methods that greedily resample similar k-order relationships, HoGA targets diverse modalities in higher-order topology, reducing redundancy and expanding the range of captured substructures. Applied to two single-hop attention models, HoGA achieves at least a 5% accuracy gain on all benchmark node classification datasets and outperforms recent baselines on six of eight datasets.

Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

This work introduces Bayesian Tensor Network Volterra kernel machines (BTN-V), extending the Bayesian Tensor Network framework to Volterra system identification. BTN-V represents Volterra kernels using canonical polyadic decomposition, reducing model complexity from O(I^D) to O(DIR). By treating all tensor components and hyperparameters as random variables, BTN-V provides predictive uncertainty estimation at no additional computational cost. Sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors enable automatic rank determination and the learning of fading-memory behavior directly from data, improving interpretability and preventing overfitting. Empirical results demonstrate competitive accuracy, enhanced uncertainty quantification, and reduced computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

| **[LFaB: Low fidelity as Bias for Active Learning in the chemical configuration space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15577v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning promises to provide an optimal training sample selection procedure in the construction of machine learning models. It often relies on minimizing the model's variance, which is assumed to decrease the prediction error. Still, it is frequently even less efficient than pure random sampling. Motivated by the bias-variance decomposition, we propose to minimize the model's bias instead of its variance. By doing so, we are able to almost exactly match the best-case error over all possible greedy sample selection procedures for a relevant application. Our bias approximation is based on using cheap to calculate low fidelity data as known from $Δ$-ML or multifidelity machine learning. We exemplify our approach for a wider class of applications in quantum chemistry including predicting excitation energies and ab initio potential energy surfaces. Here, the proposed method reduces training data consumption by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard active learning.</p></details> | SI included in main |
| **[A Surrogate-Informed Framework for Sparse Grid Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20187v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximating complex, high-dimensional, and computationally expensive functions is a central problem in science and engineering. Standard sparse grids offer a powerful solution by mitigating the curse of dimensionality compared to full tensor grids. However, they treat all regions of the domain isotropically, which may not be efficient for functions with localized or anisotropic behavior. This work presents a surrogate-informed framework for constructing sparse grid interpolants, which is guided by an error indicator that serves as a zero-cost estimate for the hierarchical surplus. This indicator is calculated for all candidate points, defined as those in the next-level grid $w+1$ not already present in the base grid $w$. It quantifies the local approximation error by measuring the relative difference between the predictions of two consecutive interpolants of level $w$ and $w-1$. The candidates are then ranked by this metric to select the most impactful points for refinement up to a given budget or following another criterion, as, e.g., a given threshold in the error indicator. The final higher-order model is then constructed using a surrogate-informed approach: the objective function is evaluated only at the selected high-priority points, while for the remaining nodes of the $w+1$ grid, we assign the values predicted by the initial $w$-level surrogate. This strategy significantly reduces the required number of expensive evaluations, yielding a final model that closely approximates the accuracy of a fully-resolved $w+1$ grid at a fraction of the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed surrogate-informed refinement criterion is demonstrated for several analytic function and for a real engineering problem, i.e., the analysis of sensitivity to geometrical parameters of numerically predicted flashback phenomenon in hydrogen-fueled perforated burners.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSI Prediction Frameworks for Enhanced 5G Link Adaptation: Performance-Complexity Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20160v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is fundamental for efficient link adaptation. However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE).</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4x and 3.85x lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Learning at Machine Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19980v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03827v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings, BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems, SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the runtime by at least an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>An op...</summary><p>An open-source implementation of SNBO is available at: https://github.com/ComputationalDesignLab/snbo</p></details> |
| **[Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: "harmless" divergences that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within behavioral decision boundaries, and "pernicious" divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we apply and modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) allowing representations from causal interventions to remain closer to the natural distribution, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of the interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19364v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Biosecurity Safeguards for Generative AI</p></details> |

In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables,</p></details> |
| **[VALUE: Value-Aware Large Language Model for Query Rewriting via Weighted Trie in Sponsored Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05321v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-to-bidword(i.e., bidding keyword) rewriting is fundamental to sponsored search, transforming noisy user queries into semantically relevant and commercially valuable keywords. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) improve semantic relevance through generative retrieval frameworks, but they rarely encode the commercial value of keywords. As a result, rewrites are often semantically correct yet economically suboptimal, and a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stage is usually added after supervised fine-tuning(SFT) to mitigate this deficiency. However, conventional preference alignment frequently overemphasize the ordering of bidword values and is susceptible to overfitting, which degrades rewrite quality. In addition, bidword value changes rapidly, while existing generative methods do not respond to these fluctuations. To address this shortcoming, we introduce VALUE(Value-Aware Large language model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), a framework that integrates value awareness directly into generation and enhances value alignment during training. VALUE employs the Weighted Trie, a novel variant of the classical trie that stores real-time value signals for each token. During decoding, the framework adjusts the LLM's token probabilities with these signals, constraining the search space and steering generation toward high-value rewrites. The alignment stage uses a fine-grained preference learning strategy that emphasizes stable, high-value differences and down-weights noisy or transient fluctuations, thereby improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Offline experiments show that VALUE significantly outperforms baselines in both semantic matching and value-centric metrics. VALUE has been deployed on our advertising system since October 2024 and served the Double Eleven promotions, the biggest shopping carnival in China.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Benefit of Curriculum in Transformer Tree-Reasoning Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07372v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck. To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Features to Reference Points: Lightweight and Adaptive Fusion for Cooperative Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18757v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RefPtsFusion, a lightweight and interpretable framework for cooperative autonomous driving. Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Democratic Recommendation with User and Item Representatives Produced by Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18279v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenges associated with large-scale user-item interaction graphs have attracted increasing attention in graph-based recommendation systems, primarily due to computational inefficiencies and inadequate information propagation. Existing methods provide partial solutions but suffer from notable limitations: model-centric approaches, such as sampling and aggregation, often struggle with generalization, while data-centric techniques, including graph sparsification and coarsening, lead to information loss and ineffective handling of bipartite graph structures. Recent advances in graph condensation offer a promising direction by reducing graph size while preserving essential information, presenting a novel approach to mitigating these challenges. Inspired by the principles of democracy, we propose \textbf{DemoRec}, a framework that leverages graph condensation to generate user and item representatives for recommendation tasks. By constructing a compact interaction graph and clustering nodes with shared characteristics from the original graph, DemoRec significantly reduces graph size and computational complexity. Furthermore, it mitigates the over-reliance on high-order information, a critical challenge in large-scale bipartite graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DemoRec, showcasing substantial improvements in recommendation performance, computational efficiency, and robustness compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[FAST: Topology-Aware Frequency-Domain Distribution Matching for Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19476v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coreset selection compresses large datasets into compact, representative subsets, reducing the energy and computational burden of training deep neural networks. Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a "vanishing phase gradient" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%. Compared to other baseline coreset methods, it reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup, underscoring its high performance and energy efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemoShapley: Valuation of Demonstrations for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07523v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning (ICL) excel in many tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, demonstration selection and ordering greatly impact ICL effectiveness. Focus on this issue, we propose DemoShapley, a Shapley-value based method that evaluates each demonstration's contribution by measuring its marginal effect across different prompt permutations. To further account for ICL's limited context windows and frequent low-shot settings, we introduce Beta-DemoShapley, a weighted extension that emphasizes the influence of smaller prompt sizes. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that DemoShapley consistently outperforms existing influence-based selection strategies, while Beta-DemoShapley further improves performance in low-shot scenarios. Both methods also detect mislabeled data, enhance generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, and reduce demographic bias. Together, they provide a unified and robust framework for demonstration valuation in ICL.</p></details> |  |

This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural network. Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent. When combined, neural networks that use both training data augmentation and a less complex set of inputs have a posteriori performance far more reflective of their a priori evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing the Forest and the Trees: Query-Aware Tokenizer for Long-Video Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11910v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage. Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[You Only Forward Once: An Efficient Compositional Judging Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16600v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis -- where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones -- and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid coupling with operator inference and the overlapping Schwarz alternating method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20687v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Penalty-Based Bilevel Methods: Improved Analysis, Novel Updates, and Flatness Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16796v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penalty-based methods have become popular for solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems, thanks to their effective first-order nature. However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the "flatness" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.20400</p></details> |

Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fast-DataShapley: Neural Modeling for Training Data Valuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05281v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers' legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines. Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2 times, and the explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

Rather than stemming from material utility or cash flows, Bitcoin's value arises from informational attributes and interactions of multiple factors, including cryptographic order, decentralization-enabled autonomy, trust embedded in the consensus mechanism, and socio-narrative coherence that reduce entropy within decentralized value-exchange processes. To empirically assess this perspective, a Bayesian linear model was estimated using daily data from 2022 to 2025, operationalizing four informational value dimensions: Store-of-Value (SOV), Autonomy (AUT), Social-Signal Value (SSV), and Hedonic-Sentiment Value (HSV). Results indicate that only SSV exerts a highly credible positive effect on next-day returns, highlighting the dominant role of high-entropy social information in short-term pricing dynamics. In contrast, SOV and AUT show moderately reliable positive associations, reflecting their roles as low-entropy structural anchors of long-term value. HSV displays no credible predictive effect. The study advances interdisciplinary value theory and demonstrates Bitcoin as a dual-layer entropy-regulating socio-technological ecosystem. The findings offer implications for digital asset valuation, investment education, and future research on entropy dynamics across non-cash-flow digital assets.</p></details> |  |

The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable</p></details> |  |

Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, includes appendix with additional visualizations, submitted as arXiv preprint</p></details> |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality.

We introduce a multifaceted power model in which the expectation of an arbitrary number of arbitrary functions of the normalized average power is constrained. The framework generalizes existing models, recovering the standard maximal and expected power constraints and the recent mean and variance constraint as special cases. Under certain growth and continuity assumptions on the functions, our main theorem gives an exact characterization of the minimum average error probability for Gaussian channels as a function of the first- and second-order coding rates. The converse proof reduces the code design problem to minimization over a compact (under the Prokhorov metric) set of probability distributions, characterizes the extreme points of this set and invokes the Bauer's maximization principle.</p></details> |  |

While model fidelity is crucial in MPC, solving the corresponding optimization problem in real time remains challenging when combining long horizons with high-fidelity models that capture both short-term dynamics and long-term behavior. Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Structured Data Extraction from Perspectively Distorted Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17607v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures |

Zeroth-Order Optimization for Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12409v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Continual Learning (VLCL) has attracted significant research attention for its robust capabilities, and the adoption of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies is enabling these models to achieve competitive performance with substantially reduced resource consumption. However, dominated First-Order (FO) optimization is prone to trap models in suboptimal local minima, especially in limited exploration subspace within PEFT. To overcome this challenge, this paper pioneers a systematic exploration of adopting Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for PEFT-based VLCL. We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO adoption in VLCL due to optimization process instability. We then investigate the application of ZO optimization from a modality branch-wise to a fine-grained layer-wise across various training units to identify an optimal strategy. Besides, a key theoretical insight reveals that vision modality exhibit higher variance than language counterparts in VLCL during the ZO optimization process, and we propose a modality-aware ZO strategy, which adopts gradient sign normalization in ZO and constrains vision modality perturbation to further improve performance.

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead. Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper accepted for presentation to the 16th ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SOCC'25)</p></details> |

We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Sparsity-Enabled Multipath Perception via Structured Bayesian Inference for Multi-Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14051v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a multi-target sensing system in multipath environment, where inter-target scattering gives rise to first-order reflected paths whose angles of departure (AoDs) and angles of arrival (AoAs) coincide with the direct-path angles of different targets. Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Higher-Order Transformers With Kronecker-Structured Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02919v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern datasets are increasingly high-dimensional and multiway, often represented as tensor-valued data with multi-indexed variables. While Transformers excel in sequence modeling and high-dimensional tasks, their direct application to multiway data is computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of dot-product attention and the need to flatten inputs, which disrupts tensor structure and cross-dimensional dependencies. We propose the Higher-Order Transformer (HOT), a novel factorized attention framework that represents multiway attention as sums of Kronecker products or sums of mode-wise attention matrices. HOT efficiently captures dense and sparse relationships across dimensions while preserving tensor structure. Theoretically, HOT retains the expressiveness of full high-order attention and allows complexity control via factorization rank. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that HOT achieves competitive performance in multivariate time series forecasting and image classification, with significantly reduced computational and memory costs. Visualizations of mode-wise attention matrices further reveal interpretable high-order dependencies learned by HOT, demonstrating its versatility for complex multiway data across diverse domains. The implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/s-omranpour/HOT.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from the brain, we present a biologically plausible extension of the eligibility propagation (e-prop) learning rule for recurrent spiking networks. By translating the time-driven update scheme into an event-driven one, we integrate the learning rule into a simulation platform for large-scale spiking neural networks and demonstrate its applicability to tasks such as neuromorphic MNIST. We extend the model with prominent biological features such as continuous dynamics and weight updates, strict locality, and sparse connectivity. Our results show that biologically grounded constraints can inform the design of computationally efficient AI algorithms, offering scalability to millions of neurons without compromising learning performance. This work bridges machine learning and computational neuroscience, paving the way for sustainable, biologically inspired AI systems while advancing our understanding of brain-like learning.</p></details> |  |

Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 43rd Conference of the International System Dynamics Society in Boston, United States</p></details> |

It has been widely studied in discrete-time settings where a key notion is the bisimulation metric which quantifies "how similar two states are". In [ 11], we generalized the concept of bisimulation metric in order to metrize the behaviour of continuous-time Markov processes. Similarly to the discrete-time case, we constructed a pseudometric following two iterative approaches - through a functional and through a real-valued logic, and showed that the outcomes coincide: the pseudometric obtained from the logic is a specific fixpoint of the functional which yields our first pseudometric. However, different from the discrete-time setting, in which the process has a step-by-step dynamics, the behavioural pseudometric we constructed applies to Markov processes that evolve continuously through time, such as diffusions and jump diffusions. While our treatment of the pseudometric in [11] relied on the time-indexed Markov kernels, in [ 8 , 9, 10 ], we showed the importance of trajectories in the consideration of behavioural equivalences for true continuous-time Markov processes. In this paper, we take the work from [11 ] further and propose a second behavioural pseudometric for diffusions based on trajectories. We conduct a similar study of this pseudometric from both the perspective of a functional and the viewpoint of a real-valued logic. We also compare this pseudometric with the first pseudometric obtained in [11].</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2312.16729</p></details> |

Properly modeling this data can enable applications such as abnormal behavior detection and consumer-level insights for hyper-personalized experiences, ultimately improving people's lives. In this paper, we present TREASURE, TRansformer Engine As Scalable Universal transaction Representation Encoder, a multipurpose transformer-based foundation model specifically designed for transaction data. The model simultaneously captures both consumer behavior and payment network signals (such as response codes and system flags), providing comprehensive information necessary for applications like accurate recommendation systems and abnormal behavior detection. Verified with industry-grade datasets, TREASURE features three key capabilities: 1) an input module with dedicated sub-modules for static and dynamic attributes, enabling more efficient training and inference; 2) an efficient and effective training paradigm for predicting high-cardinality categorical attributes; and 3) demonstrated effectiveness as both a standalone model that increases abnormal behavior detection performance by 111% over production systems and an embedding provider that enhances recommendation models by 104%. We present key insights from extensive ablation studies, benchmarks against production models, and case studies, highlighting valuable knowledge gained from developing TREASURE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation for 3D Point Cloud Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21574v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Decidability Results for Systems with Continuous Counters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21559v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counters that hold natural numbers are ubiquitous in modeling and verifying software systems; for example, they model dynamic creation and use of resources in concurrent programs. Unfortunately, such discrete counters often lead to extremely high complexity. Continuous counters are an efficient over-approximation of discrete counters. They are obtained by relaxing the original counters to hold values over the non-negative rational numbers. This work shows that continuous counters are extraordinarily well-behaved in terms of decidability. Our main result is that, despite continuous counters being infinite-state, the language of sequences of counter instructions that can arrive in a given target configuration, is regular. Moreover, a finite automaton for this language can be computed effectively. This implies that a wide variety of transition systems can be equipped with continuous counters, while maintaining decidability of reachability properties. Examples include higher-order recursion schemes, well-structured transition systems, and decidable extensions of discrete counter systems. We also prove a non-elementary lower bound for the size of the resulting finite automaton.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures including appendices.

Recent systems have explored architectural support for TLP on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), often leveraging high-level synthesis (HLS) to create processing elements (PEs). In this paper, we present Bombyx, a compiler toolchain that lowers OpenCilk programs into a Cilk-1-inspired intermediate representation, enabling efficient mapping of CPU-oriented TLP applications to spatial architectures on FPGAs. Unlike OpenCilk's implicit task model, which requires costly context switching in hardware, Cilk-1 adopts explicit continuation-passing - a model that better aligns with the streaming nature of FPGAs. Bombyx supports multiple compilation targets: one is an OpenCilk-compatible runtime for executing Cilk-1-style code using the OpenCilk backend, and another is a synthesizable PE generator designed for HLS tools like Vitis HLS. Additionally, we introduce a decoupled access-execute optimization that enables automatic generation of high-performance PEs, improving memory-compute overlap and overall throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 16 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superstate Quantum Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00037v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Superstate Quantum Mechanics (SQM), a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints, with ``energy'' also expressed as a quadratic function of these states. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization with energy expressed as a quadratic form involving the Hamiltonian. When SQM represents states as unitary operators, the stationary problem becomes a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Any stationary SQM problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The non-stationary SQM problem considers the evolution of the system itself, involving the same ``energy'' operator as in the stationary case. Two possible options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order quantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits transform one quantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type nonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms. As an immediately available practical application of the theory, we consider using a quantum channel as a classical computational model; this type of computation can be performed on a classical computer.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The ML approach presented in arXiv:2407.04406 is extended to stationary and non-stationary quantum dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Lighting Control in Visible Light Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Illumination Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21271v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is a promising sixth-generation (6G) technology, as its directional and sensitive optical signals are naturally suited for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion. The decoder incorporates a dynamic weight computation network to achieve thorough integration of multi-layer features, and a hybrid loss function is adopted to optimize model training. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 69.79% and an F1-score of 80.49%, outperforming the baseline network by 2.1% and 1.61%, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary nature of multi-layer feature fusion, which effectively improves the IoU for micro-habitat categories such as field ridges. This study establishes a habitat identification framework for cultivated land systems based on adaptive multi-layer feature fusion, enabling sub-meter precision habitat mapping at a low cost and providing robust technical support for fine-grained habitat monitoring in cultivated landscapes.

| **[DynamicAdaptiveClimb: Adaptive Cache Replacement with Dynamic Resizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21235v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, Patented</p></details> |

However, numerically robust and mathematically correct implementations, particularly on SO(3), are error-prone due to issues such as axis conventions, normalizations, composition consistency and subtle errors that only appear in edge cases. SciPy's spatial$.$transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial$.$transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics. Our contributions have been merged into SciPy main and will ship in the next release, providing a framework-agnostic, production-grade basis for 3D spatial math in differentiable systems and ML.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as oral at the 1st Workshop on Differentiable Systems and Scientific Machine Learning @ EurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18866v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. On LongMemEval and LoCoMo, using GPT and Qwen backbones, LightMem consistently surpasses strong baselines, improving QA accuracy by up to 7.7% / 29.3%, reducing total token usage by up to 38x / 20.9x and API calls by up to 30x / 55.5x, while purely online test-time costs are even lower, achieving up to 106x / 117x token reduction and 159x / 310x fewer API calls. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Digital Twin-Driven Secure Access Strategy for SAGIN-Enabled IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21156v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN)-enabled IoT networks, secure access has become a significant challenge due to the increasing risks of eavesdropping attacks. To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions. Furthermore, a novel distributed algorithm, integral to the DT operation, is developed to obtain the equilibrium access strategy for each device in a scalable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based approach substantially improves the security of SAGIN-enabled IoT networks. Additionally, it effectively balances system load, prevents overload occurrences, and decreases queuing delay compared to benchmark schemes, thereby comprehensively improving overall network performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18579v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance. This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations. Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in IEEE Control Systems Letters (LCSS). 6 pages</p></details> |

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, 3 figures, ISVC conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Network Dynamical Systems Approach to SDGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21091v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a complex, interdependent framework where progress in one area can synergistically promote or competitively inhibit progress in others. For policymakers in international development, a critical challenge is identifying "leverage points" - specific goals where limited resource allocation yields the maximum system-wide benefit. This study addresses this challenge by modeling the SDGs as a Networked Dynamical System (NDS). Using empirical data from Our World in Data (2018), we construct a weighted interaction network of 16 SDG indicators. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression to derive coupling weights empirically. Unlike previous static analyses, we simulate the temporal evolution of development indicators using an extended Lotka-Volterra model. To ensure numerical stability and sophistication, we upgrade the simulation method from standard Euler integration to the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method. Our simulation, applied to a case study of Mexico, reveals that SDG 4 (Quality Education) acts as a critical driver, suggesting that prioritizing education yields the most significant positive spillover effects across the development network. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis and explore the power-law relationship between investment and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Codes Kernelization Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21067v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Identifying Code (IC) problem seeks a vertex subset whose intersection with every vertex's closed neighborhood is unique, enabling fault detection in multiprocessor systems and practical uses in identity verification, environmental monitoring, and dynamic localization. A closely related problem is the Locating-Dominating Set (LD), which requires each non-dominating vertex to be uniquely identified by its intersection with the set. Cappelle, Gomes, and Santos (2021) proved that LD is W-hard for minimum clique cover and lacks polynomial kernels for parameters such as vertex cover, but their methods did not apply to IC. This paper answers their question by showing that IC does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by solution size plus vertex cover unless NP is a subset of coNP/poly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Organization and Spectral Mechanism of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a "Ridge of Optimization" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a "Force Antagonism," where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral "Goldilocks zone" between rank collapse and diffusion.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Single- vs. Dual-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Bike Rebalancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03589v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bike-sharing systems (BSS) provide a sustainable urban mobility solution, but ensuring their reliability requires effective rebalancing strategies to address stochastic demand and prevent station imbalances. This paper proposes reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for dynamic rebalancing problem with multiple vehicles, introducing and comparing two RL approaches: Single-policy RL and Dual-policy RL. We formulate this network optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process within a continuous-time framework, allowing vehicles to make independent and cooperative rebalancing decisions without synchronization constraints. In the first approach, a single deep Q-network (DQN) is trained to jointly learn inventory and routing decisions. The second approach decouples node-level inventory decisions from arc-level vehicle routing, enhancing learning efficiency and adaptability. A high-fidelity simulator under the first-arrive-first-serve rule is developed to estimate rewards across diverse demand scenarios influenced by temporal and weather variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while the single-policy model is competitive against several benchmarks, the dual-policy model significantly reduces lost demand. These findings provide valuable insights for bike-sharing operators, reinforcing the potential of RL for real-time rebalancing and paving the way for more adaptive and intelligent urban mobility solutions.</p></details> |  |

At the other extreme, lightweight incidental systems offer flexible, in-the-moment content but rarely guide learners toward mastery. Prior work privileges either continuity (maintaining a plan across sessions) or initiative (reacting to the moment), not both, leaving learners to navigate the trade-off between recency and trajectory-immediate relevance versus cumulative, goal-aligned progress. We present LOOM, an agentic pipeline that infers evolving learner needs from recent LLM conversations and a dynamic learner memory graph, then assembles coherent learning materials personalized to the learner's current needs, priorities, and understanding. These materials link adjacent concepts and surface gaps as tightly scoped modules that cumulatively advance broader goals, providing guidance and sustained progress while remaining responsive to new interests. We describe LOOM's end-to-end architecture and working prototype, including conversation summarization, topic planning, course generation, and graph-based progress tracking. In a formative study with ten participants, users reported that LOOM's generated lessons felt relevant to their recent activities and helped them recognize knowledge gaps, though they also highlighted needs for greater consistency and control. We conclude with design implications for more robust, mixed-initiative learning pipelines that integrate structured learner modelling with everyday LLM interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the PerFM Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, empirical patterns show that such transfers often fail to close structural preference gaps. This paper introduces a market microstructure framework that models matching decisions as a limit order book system with rigid bid ask spreads. Individual preferences are represented by a latent preference state matrix, where the spread between an agent's internal ask price (the unconditional maximum) and the market's best bid (the reachable maximum) creates a structural liquidity constraint. We establish a Threshold Impossibility Theorem showing that linear compensation cannot close these spreads unless it induces a categorical identity shift. A dynamic discrete choice execution model further demonstrates that matches occur only when the market to book ratio crosses a time decaying liquidity threshold, analogous to order execution under inventory pressure. Numerical experiments validate persistent slippage, regional invariance of preference orderings, and high tier zero spread executions. The model provides a unified microstructure explanation for matching failures, compensation inefficiency, and post match regret in illiquid order driven environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, 5 experiments, 6 appendices.

| **[IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality. First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically. Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Bachelor of Science (BSc) Thesis 2017.

While these systems appear to meet basic needs for connection, mounting safety concerns raise a deeper question: how do processes of emotional bonding and intimacy formation unfold in human-AI relationships? Prior research has relied largely on self-reports, interviews, or clinical assessments, leaving unclear how real-world emotional dynamics develop within ongoing human-AI conversations. We address this gap by analyzing over 17,000 user-shared chats with social chatbots from Reddit forums. We show that AI companions dynamically track and mimic user affect and amplify positive emotions, including when users share explicit or transgressive content. These dynamics suggest how chatbots can engage psychological processes involved in intimacy formation and emotional bonding. Finally, we release an anonymized dataset of emotionally salient human-AI companion dialogues to support future empirical work and discuss implications for redesigning and governing social chatbots as high-risk systems for vulnerable users.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRAGMENTA: End-to-end Fragmentation-based Generative Model with Agentic Tuning for Drug Lead Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20510v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule generation using generative AI is vital for drug discovery, yet class-specific datasets often contain fewer than 100 training examples. While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a "vocabulary selection" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines. Furthermore, the fully autonomous Agent-Agent system outperformed traditional Human-Human tuning, demonstrating the efficacy of agentic tuning in capturing expert intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic PD-Disaggregation Architecture for Maximizing Goodput in LLM Inference Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22779v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second, simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally, numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are conducted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Adversarial Post-Training Mitigates Reward Hacking in Live Human-AI Music Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17879v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most applications of generative AI involve a sequential interaction in which a person inputs a prompt and waits for a response, and where reaction time and adaptivity are not important factors. In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models.</p></details> |  |
| **[KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15974v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Quantum Missteps in Agent-Based Modeling: A Schelling Model Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15642v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from "simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence" to "compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Charging Infrastructure via Decentralized Coordination of Electric Vehicles at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20943v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces major challenges for decentralized charging control. Existing decentralized approaches efficiently coordinate a large number of EVs to select charging stations while reducing energy costs, preventing power peak and preserving driver privacy. However, they often struggle under severe contingencies, such as station outages or unexpected surges in charging requests. These situations create competition for limited charging slots, resulting in long queues and reduced driver comfort. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collective learning-based coordination framework that allows EVs to balance individual comfort on their selections against system-wide efficiency, i.e., the overall queues across all stations. In the framework, EVs are recommended for adaptive charging behaviors that shift priority between comfort and efficiency, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying station capacities and dynamic spatio-temporal EV distribution. Experiments using real-world data from EVs and charging stations show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing travel and queuing time. The results reveal that, under uncertain charging conditions, EV drivers that behave selfishly or altruistically at the right moments achieve shorter waiting time than those maintaining moderate behavior throughout. Our findings under high fractions of station outages and adversarial EVs further demonstrate improved resilience and trustworthiness of decentralized EV charging infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures.

KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[Securing the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Risks, Controls, and Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20920v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) replaces static, developer-controlled API integrations with more dynamic, user-driven agent systems, which also introduces new security risks. As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end. We close by outlining open research questions around verifiable registries, formal methods for these dynamic systems, and privacy-preserving agent operations.</p></details> |  |
