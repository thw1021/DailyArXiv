| **[OmniFluids: Physics Pre-trained Modeling of Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10862v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) drives progress in numerous scientific and engineering fields, yet high-fidelity simulations remain computationally prohibitive. While machine learning approaches offer computing acceleration, they typically specialize in single physical systems or require extensive training data, hindering their applicability in highly nonlinear and 3D flow scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniFluids, a pure physics pre-trained model that captures fundamental fluid dynamics laws and adapts efficiently to diverse downstream tasks with minimal data. We develop a training framework combining physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. This enables OmniFluids to retain broad physics knowledge while delivering fast and accurate predictions. Architecturally, OmniFluids integrates a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, seamlessly incorporating physics-based supervision while allowing efficient and scalable modeling of diverse tasks. Extensive tests on a broad range of 2D and 3D benchmarks show that OmniFluids outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in terms of flow field prediction and turbulence statistics. It delivers 10--100$\times$ speedups over traditional solvers while maintaining a comparable accuracy and accurately identifies unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work demonstrates the potential of training a unified CFD solver exclusively from physics knowledge, offering a new approach for efficient and generalizable modeling across complex fluid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffeomorphic Neural Operator Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06690v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an operator learning approach for a class of evolution operators using a composition of a learned lift into the space of diffeomorphisms of the domain and the group action on the field space. In turn, this transforms the semigroup structure of the evolution operator into a corresponding group structure allowing time stepping be performed through composition on the space of diffeomorphisms rather than in the field space directly. This results in a number of structure-preserving properties related to preserving a relabelling symmetry of the dynamics as a hard constraint. We study the resolution properties of our approach, along with its connection to the techniques of diffeomorphic image registration. Numerical experiments on forecasting turbulent fluid dynamics are provided, demonstrating its conservative properties, non-diffusivity, and ability to capture anticipated statistical scaling relations at sub-grid scales. Our method provides an example of geometric operator learning and indicates a clear performance benefit from leveraging a priori known infinite-dimensional geometric structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monolithic Multi-level Overlapping Schwarz Solvers for Fluid Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04356v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Additive overlapping Schwarz Methods are iterative methods of the domain decomposition type for the solution of partial differential equations. Numerical and parallel scalability of these methods can be achieved by adding coarse levels. A successful coarse space, inspired by iterative substructuring, is the generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) space. In https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1184047, based on the GDSW approach, two-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for saddle point problems were introduced. We present parallel results up to 32768 MPI ranks for the solution of incompressible fluid problems for a Poiseuille flow example on the unit cube and a complex extrusion die geometry using a two- and a three-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. These results are achieved through the combination of the additive overlapping Schwarz solvers implemented in the Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56750-7_19, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.64, and the FEATFLOW library http://www.featflow.de using a scalable interface for the efficient coupling of the two libraries. This work is part of the project StroemungsRaum - Novel Exascale-Architectures with Heterogeneous Hardware Components for Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations, funded by the German Bundesministerium fur Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt BMFTR (formerly BMBF) as part of the program on New Methods and Technologies for Exascale Computing (SCALEXA).</p></details> | <details><summary>GAMM9...</summary><p>GAMM95; fixed typo in metadata</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Linear Baseline Models for Scientific Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05831v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging, financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific machine learning problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 10 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven control of a magnetohydrodynamic flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12479v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; name changed, added references, polished language, expanded appendix</p></details> |
| **[Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Two-Phase Viscoelastic Fluid Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19974v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural, and biomedical systems. We consider a model that uses a continuum description of both phases in which separate momentum equations are used for each phase along with a co-incompressibility condition on the velocity fields. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and the co-incompressibility condition, and the resulting fluid dynamics motivate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to accurately capture regions of high stresses and large material gradients while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR discretization asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioning strategy introduced herein, the linear solver iterations are independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to ten fold speedup over a uniform grid in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-physics Model of Flow from Coronary Angiography: Insights to Microvascular Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04798v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) is characterized by impaired vasodilation and can lead to insufficient blood flow to the myocardium during stress or exertion, affecting millions of people globally. Despite their diagnostic value, invasive, wire-based diagnosis techniques of CMD, such as index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), are underutilized due to their complexity and inconsistency. Coronary angiography, one of the most commonly used imaging modalities, offers valuable flow information that assists in diagnosing CMD. However, this information is not fully understood or utilized in current clinical practice. In this study, a 3D-0D coupled multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and calibrated to simulate and study the process of contrast injection and washout during clinical angiography. A contrast intensity profile (CIP) was introduced to describe the dynamics of coronary angiography data. Additionally, sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of various coronary lumped parameter model (LPM) parameters on the shapes of CIPs. The results demonstrate that the multi-physics model can be effectively calibrated to produce physiologically meaningful hemodynamic results. Sensitivity studies reveal that resistance has a greater impact on the rising and falling slopes of CIP than capacitance, with higher resistance amplifying this effect. The model and results are presented here. These results are potentially transformative, as they provide a tool for interpreting angiographic data and ultimately extracting information concerning coronary microcirculation.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Wall Shear Stress Estimation in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: Towards Generalisable Neural Surrogate Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22817v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years, geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution, as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic parameter estimation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Experiment Execution in Support of Community Benchmark Workflows for HPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22294v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key hurdle is demonstrating compute resource capability with limited benchmarks. We propose workflow templates as a solution, offering adaptable designs for specific scientific applications. Our paper identifies common usage patterns for these templates, drawn from decades of HPC experience, including recent work with the MLCommons Science working group. We found that focusing on simple experiment management tools within the broader computational workflow improves adaptability, especially in education. This concept, which we term benchmark carpentry, is validated by two independent tools: Cloudmesh's Experiment Executor and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's SmartSim. Both frameworks, with significant functional overlap, have been tested across various scientific applications, including conduction cloudmask, earthquake prediction, simulation-AI/ML interactions, and the development of computational fluid dynamics surrogates.</p></details> |  |
| **[diffSPH: Differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for Adjoint Optimization and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21684v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability, and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin Reduced Order Models for fluid flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20739v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research paper investigates the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) method for reduced order models (ROM) and fluid dynamics governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape Invariant 3D-Variational Autoencoder: Super Resolution in Turbulence flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22082v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning provides a versatile suite of methods for extracting structured information from complex datasets, enabling deeper understanding of underlying fluid dynamic phenomena. The field of turbulence modeling, in particular, benefits from the growing availability of high-dimensional data obtained through experiments, field observations, and large-scale simulations spanning multiple spatio-temporal scales. This report presents a concise overview of both classical and deep learningbased approaches to turbulence modeling. It further investigates two specific challenges at the intersection of fluid dynamics and machine learning: the integration of multiscale turbulence models with deep learning architectures, and the application of deep generative models for super-resolution reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi Steady-State Frequency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21461v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean flow data assimilation using physics-constrained Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On zero-order consistency residue and background pressure for the conservative SPH fluid dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18210v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the major challenges for the conservative smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, the zero-order consistency issue, although thought to be mitigated by the particle regularization scheme, such as the transport velocity formulation, significantly damps the flow in a long channel for both laminar and turbulent simulations. Building on this finding, this paper not only thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel flow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical numerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient consistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background pressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To comprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its potential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the residue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid standing wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the pressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length, resolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient correction technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be effective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability is fundamentally limited. Finally, the FDA nozzle, an engineering benchmark, is tested to demonstrate the residue influence in a complex geometry, highlighting the necessity of correction schemes in scenarios with unavoidable high background pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages and 27 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Accelerated Aerodynamic Shape Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17786v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based, actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing' of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving the desired flow-field. By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense of a feature importance scoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A deterministic-particle-based scheme for micro-macro viscoelastic flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10970v8)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we introduce a new method for discretizing micro-macro models of dilute polymeric fluids by integrating a finite element discretization for the macroscopic fluid dynamic equation with a deterministic variational particle scheme for the microscopic Fokker-Planck equation. To address challenges arising from micro-macro coupling, we employ a discrete energetic variational approach to derive a coarse-grained micro-macro model with a particle approximation first and then develop a particle-FEM discretization for the coarse-grained model. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated for a Hookean dumbbell model in a Couette flow by comparing the computed velocity field with existing analytical solutions. We also use our method to study nonlinear FENE dumbbell models in different scenarios, such as extension flow, pure shear flow, and lid-driven cavity flow. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed deterministic particle approach can accurately capture the various key rheological phenomena in the original FENE model, including hysteresis and {\delta}-function-like spike behavior in extension flows, velocity overshoot phenomenon in pure shear flow, symmetries breaking, vortex center shifting and vortices weakening in the lid-driven cavity flow, with a small number of particles.</p></details> |  |
| **[The inverse initial data problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations via Legendre time reduction method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16810v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the inverse initial data problem for the compressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial velocity field from lateral boundary observations. This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking machine learning models for predicting aerofoil performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15993v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the capability of Neural Networks (NNs) as alternatives to the traditional methods to analyse the performance of aerofoils used in the wind and tidal energy industry. The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANSdataset benchmark is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range of aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$) to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the training phase, but underperformed during testing. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, submitted to EWTEC</p></details> |

This work introduces a posthoc interpretability framework for graph-based surrogate models used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By obtaining an overcomplete basis in the node embedding space of a pretrained surrogate, the method extracts a dictionary of interpretable latent features. The approach enables the identification of monosemantic concepts aligned with physical phenomena such as vorticity or flow structures, offering a model-agnostic pathway to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in CFD applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</p></details> |
| **[Low-Latency Event-Based Velocimetry for Quadrotor Control in a Narrow Pipe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15444v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow, circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Quantifying data needs in surrogate modeling for flow fields in two-dimensional stirred tanks with physics-informed neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11640v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stirred tanks are vital in chemical and biotechnological processes, particularly as bioreactors. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to model the flow in stirred tanks, its high computational cost$-$especially in multi-query scenarios for process design and optimization$-$drives the need for efficient data-driven surrogate models. However, acquiring sufficiently large datasets can be costly. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution to reduce data requirements while maintaining accuracy by embedding underlying physics into neural network (NN) training. This study quantifies the data requirements of vanilla PINNs for developing surrogate models of a flow field in a 2D stirred tank. We compare these requirements with classical supervised neural networks and boundary-informed neural networks (BINNs). Our findings demonstrate that surrogate models can achieve prediction errors around 3% across Reynolds numbers from 50 to 5000 using as few as six datapoints. Moreover, employing an approximation of the velocity profile in place of real data labels leads to prediction errors of around 2.5%. These results indicate that even with limited or approximate datasets, PINNs can be effectively trained to deliver high accuracy comparable to high-fidelity data.</p></details> | 24 pages, 18 figures |
| **[GradNetOT: Learning Optimal Transport Maps with GradNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13191v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In [arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our method for a robot swarm control problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[AortaDiff: Volume-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models for Multi-Branch Aortic Surface Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13404v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate Quantum Circuit Design for the Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12256v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM. Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step, implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity, demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow recirculation.</p></details> | 31 pages, 14 figures |

This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for a Computational Pulmonary Hemodynamics Model Using Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14251v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-specific modeling is a powerful tool in cardiovascular research, providing insights beyond the reach of current clinical diagnostics. Limitations in available clinical data require the incorporation of uncertainty into models to improve guidance for personalized treatments. However, for clinical relevance, such modeling must be computationally efficient. In this study, we used a one-dimensional (1D) fluid dynamics model informed by experimental data from a dog model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), incorporating measurements from multiple subjects under both baseline and CTEPH conditions. Surgical intervention can alleviate CTEPH, yet patients with microvascular disease (e.g., remodeling and narrowing of small vessels) often exhibit persistent pulmonary hypertension, highlighting the importance of assessing microvascular disease severity. Thus, each lung was modeled separately to account for the heterogeneous nature of CTEPH, allowing us to explore lung-specific microvascular narrowing and resistance. We compared inferred parameters between baseline and CTEPH and examined their correlation with clinical markers of disease severity. To accelerate model calibration, we employed Gaussian process (GP) emulators, enabling the estimation of microvascular parameters and their uncertainties within a clinically feasible timeframe. Our results demonstrated that CTEPH leads to heterogeneous microvascular adaptation, reflected in distinct parameter shifts. Notably, the changes in model parameters strongly correlated with disease severity, especially in the lung previously reported to have more advanced disease. This framework provides a rapid, uncertainty-aware method for evaluating microvascular dysfunction in CTEPH and may support more targeted treatment strategies within a timeframe suitable for clinical application.</p></details> |  |

Recently, this connection has gained renewed attention, fueled by T. Tao's programme aiming to discover blowing-up solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations using an embedded computational model. In this survey paper, we review some of the recent works that introduce novel and exciting perspectives on the representation of computability through dynamical systems. Starting from dynamical universality in a classical sense, we shall explore the modern notions of Turing universality in fluid dynamics and Topological Kleene Field Theories as a systematic way of representing computable functions by means of dynamical bordisms.

The DiffFluid model showed that diffusion models combined with Transformers are capable of predicting fluid dynamics. It uses a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework to tackle Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Our goal was to validate the reproducibility of the methods in the DiffFluid paper while testing its viability for other simulation types, particularly the Lattice Boltzmann method. Despite our computational limitations and time constraints, this work provides evidence of the flexibility and potential of the model as a general-purpose solver for fluid dynamics. Our results show both the potential and challenges of applying diffusion models to complex fluid dynamics problems. This work highlights the opportunities for future research in optimizing the computational efficiency and scaling such models in broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Symmetry Breaking in Physical Systems with Relaxed Group Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02299v8)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling symmetry breaking is essential for understanding the fundamental changes in the behaviors and properties of physical systems, from microscopic particle interactions to macroscopic phenomena like fluid dynamics and cosmic structures. Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCFormer: A Multi-Cost-Volume Network and Comprehensive Benchmark for Particle Image Velocimetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04750v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel, large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Surrogate Model for Heat Transfer Prediction in Impinging Jet Arrays using Dynamic Inlet/Outlet and Flow Rate Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07034v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a surrogate model designed to predict the Nusselt number distribution in an enclosed impinging jet arrays, where each jet function independently and where jets can be transformed from inlets to outlets, leading to a vast number of possible flow arrangements. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control. To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re < 2,000). We train two distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management applications.</p></details> | 37 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Gaussian Fluids: A Grid-Free Fluid Solver based on Gaussian Spatial Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18133v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a grid-free fluid solver featuring a novel Gaussian representation. Drawing inspiration from the expressive capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting in multi-view image reconstruction, we model the continuous flow velocity as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian functions. This representation is continuously differentiable, which enables us to derive spatial differentials directly and solve the time-dependent PDE via a custom first-order optimization tailored to fluid dynamics. Compared to traditional discretizations, which typically adopt Eulerian, Lagrangian, or hybrid perspectives, our approach is inherently memory-efficient and spatially adaptive, enabling it to preserve fine-scale structures and vortices with high fidelity. While these advantages are also sought by implicit neural representations, GSR offers enhanced robustness, accuracy, and generality across diverse fluid phenomena, with improved computational efficiency during temporal evolution. Though our first-order solver does not yet match the speed of fluid solvers using explicit representations, its continuous nature substantially reduces spatial discretization error and opens a new avenue for high-fidelity simulation. We evaluate the proposed solver across a broad range of 2D and 3D fluid phenomena, demonstrating its ability to preserve intricate vortex dynamics, accurately capture boundary-induced effects such as K\'arm\'an vortex streets, and remain robust across long time horizons - all without additional parameter tuning. Our results suggest that GSR offers a compelling direction for future research in fluid simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[From large-eddy simulations to deep learning: A U-net model for fast urban canopy flow predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06533v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wind flow fields in urban canopies is crucial for ensuring pedestrian comfort, safety, and sustainable urban design. Traditional methods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time requirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast and accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time from an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1 second on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture trained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind directions ($0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two key quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence intensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D building representations augmented with signed distance functions and their gradients as inputs, forming a $256\times256\times9$ tensor. In addition, a Spatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections. The loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their gradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases demonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for velocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity. This research shows the potential of deep learning approaches to provide fast, accurate urban wind assessments essential for creating comfortable and safe urban environments.

| **[When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04898v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator-based machine learning framework for generalizable prediction of unsteady treatment dynamics in stormwater infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04682v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are computationally efficient but oversimplify transport and reaction processes, limiting predictive accuracy and insight. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) resolves detailed turbulent transport and pollutant fate physics but incurs prohibitive computational cost for unsteady and long-term simulations. To address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 > 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 > 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and 0.4 < R2 < 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous, long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed, marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation.</p></details> | 9 figures |

A hybrid dynamics model is proposed to account for the distinct hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces across three operational zones: aerial, aquatic, and transitional hybrid regions. The model incorporates variable buoyancy, added mass effects, and fluid resistance, with thrust characteristics of submerged propellers analyzed through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A hierarchical control strategy is developed, combining twisting sliding mode control (TWSMC) for robust attitude stabilization during medium transitions with cascade PID controllers for precise motion tracking in homogeneous media. Experimental validation using a modified FPV quadrotor prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach, achieving steady-state height errors below 0.1 m and attitude fluctuations under 5{\deg} during repeated water-crossing maneuvers. The results highlight the system's adaptability to fluid medium variations while maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity.</p></details> |  |

Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these either require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have limited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead assigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever the model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a posteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these weights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to compute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted POD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced basis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and snapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how these approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without the need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with and without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell thickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent partial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this problem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using weighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold interpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer high-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |

While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Tensor-based reduction of linear parameter-varying state-space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23591v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed to assess scalability.</p></details> |  |

For this, we use a Petrov-Galerkin ansatz together with appropriate projections. Numerical results for a nonlinear circuit model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

PySHRED is a Python package that implements SHRED and several of its major extensions, including for robust sensing, reduced order modeling and physics discovery. In this paper, we introduce the version 1.0 release of PySHRED, which includes data preprocessors and a number of cutting-edge SHRED methods specifically designed to handle real-world data that may be noisy, multi-scale, parameterized, prohibitively high-dimensional, and strongly nonlinear. The package is easy to install, thoroughly-documented, supplemented with extensive code examples, and modularly-structured to support future additions.

| **[Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates for Nonintrusive Model Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nonlinear Causal Reductions to Explain Reinforcement Learning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14901v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we generate tools and concepts for minimizing a class of energy functionals in an abstract Hilbert space setting covering a wide scope of applications such as PDEs-based inverse problems and supervised learning. The approach hinges on a Hilbert space metric in the full diffeomorphism mapping space, which could be viewed as a generalized Wasserstein-2 metric. We then study a projection gradient descent method within deep neural network parameterized sets. More importantly, we develop an adaptation and expanding strategy to step-by-step enlarge the deep neural network structures. In particular, the expansion mechanism aims to enhance the alignment of the neural manifold induced natural gradient direction as well as possible with the ideal Hilbert space gradient descent direction leveraging the fact that we can evaluate projections of the Hilbert space gradient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for several simple model problems for energies arising in the context of supervised learning, model reduction, or inverse problems. In particular, we highlight the importance of assembling the neural flow matrix based on the inner product for the ambient Hilbert space. The actual algorithms are the simplest specifications of a broader spectrum based on a correspondingly wider discussion, postponing a detailed analysis to forthcoming work.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references</p></details> |
| **[Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |
| **[Kernel-based Greedy Approximation of Parametric Elliptic Boundary Value Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06731v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We recently introduced a scale of kernel-based greedy schemes for approximating the solutions of elliptic boundary value problems. The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory. The resulting representation allows one to place error bounds on the $H_{\infty}$ norm on a reduced-order representation of the system computed using finite-dimensional nonlinear Controllability and Observability Gramians.</p></details> |  |
| **[An ensemble Kalman approach to randomized maximum likelihood estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03207v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes ensemble Kalman randomized maximum likelihood estimation, a new derivative-free method for performing randomized maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method that can be used to generate approximate samples from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems. The new method has connections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so that each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed optimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members converge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and, furthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior when applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method requires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data, be evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively expensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method tractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method tailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem. Theoretical results show near-optimality of this model reduction approach via convergence to an optimal approximation of the posterior covariance as a low-rank update to the prior covariance. Numerical experiments verify theoretical results and illustrate computational acceleration through model reduction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |
| **[Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum volume coordinates for Grassmann interpolation: Lagrange, Hermite, and errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01574v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to Riemannian interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. Instead of relying on the Riemannian normal coordinates, i.e. the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps, we approach the interpolation problem with an alternative set of local coordinates and corresponding parameterizations. A special property of these coordinates is that their calculation does not require any matrix decompositions. This is a numerical advantage over Riemann normal coordinates and many other retractions on the Grassmann manifold, especially when derivative data are to be treated. To estimate the interpolation error, we examine the conditioning of these mappings and state explicit bounds. It turns out that the parameterizations are well-conditioned, but the coordinate mappings are generally not. As a remedy, we introduce maximum-volume coordinates that are based on a search for subblocks of column-orthogonal matrices of large absolute determinant. We show that the order of magnitude of the asymptotic interpolation error on $\Gr(n,p)$ is the same as in the Euclidean space. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first is an academic one, where we interpolate a parametric orthogonal projector $QQ^T$, where the $Q$--factor stems from a parametric compact QR--decomposition. The second experiment is in the context of parametric model reduction of dynamical systems, where we interpolate reduced subspaces that are obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale wind farm model for the nonlinear case.

We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</p></details> |  |

Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 4 figures, 2 tables; 25 pages supplementary material, 8 figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, cdc2025</p></details> |

By utilizing an adaptive meta-network, a simultaneously trained transform layer, entropy enhancement strategies, implementable shock interaction analysis, and a separable training process, the EGPT-PINN efficiently captures complex parameter-dependent shock formations and interactions. Numerical results of EGPT-PINN applied to the families of inviscid Burgers' equation and the Euler equations, parameterized by their initial conditions, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed technique. It accurately solves the viscosity solution via very few neurons without leveraging any {\it a priori} knowledge of the equations or its initial condition. Moreover, via a simple augmentation of the loss function by model-data mismatch, we demonstrate the robustness of EGPT-PINN in solving inverse problems more accurately than the vanilla and entropy-enhanced versions of PINN.</p></details> | 24 pages,12 figures |
| **[Automatic and Structure-Aware Sparsification of Hybrid Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18996v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) integrate mechanistic models with neural ODEs, offering strong inductive bias and flexibility, and are particularly advantageous in data-scarce healthcare settings. However, excessive latent states and interactions from mechanistic models can lead to training inefficiency and over-fitting, limiting practical effectiveness of hybrid neural ODEs. In response, we propose a new hybrid pipeline for automatic state selection and structure optimization in mechanistic neural ODEs, combining domain-informed graph modifications with data-driven regularization to sparsify the model for improving predictive performance and stability while retaining mechanistic plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show improved predictive performance and robustness with desired sparsity, establishing an effective solution for hybrid model reduction in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

This model has been shown to be unstable when the radial gradient is too steep. In this work, we present a new derivation of the Fick-Jacobs equation that results in the addition of higher order spatial derivative terms that provide additional stability in a wide variety of cases and improved solution convergence. We also derive new numerical schemes for branched nodes within networks and provide stability conditions for these schemes. The computational accuracy, efficiency, and stability of our method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical examples.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Neural empirical interpolation method for nonlinear model reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03562v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the neural empirical interpolation method (NEIM), a neural network-based alternative to the discrete empirical interpolation method for reducing the time complexity of computing the nonlinear term in a reduced order model (ROM) for a parameterized nonlinear partial differential equation. NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some "optimal" coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.

| **[Application of a Novel Model Reduction Technique to the Assessment of Boundedness/Stability of Some Delay Time-Varying Vector Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11398v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains a challenging problem with broad applications in science and engineering. Existing methods tend to produce overly conservative criteria that offer limited practical value and often fail to explicitly characterize the temporal evolution of solution norms. This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the evolution of solution norms in such systems. This approach constructs scalar counterparts for the original vector equations. We prove that the solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also include delays and variable coefficients, provide upper bounds for the norms of the original solutions, if the history functions for both equations are properly matched. This reduction enables the evaluation of the boundedness and stability of vector systems through the analysis of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, which can be performed via straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. Consequently, we introduce new criteria for boundedness and stability and estimate the radii of the balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems. Finally, we validated our inferences through representative simulations that also assessed the accuracy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 18 pages |

An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper.

| **[Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a weighted balanced truncation to construct an optimal model reduction method for compressing the number of exponentials in the sum-of-exponentials approximation of kernel functions. This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate its excellent performance and attractive features for practical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems by multivariate rational interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03057v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal approximation of linear dynamical systems with quadratic-output functions, also known as linear quadratic-output systems. Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their relevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is leveraged to delineate both known and new design methodologies for control and observation of cascades, and to characterize structural properties of reduced models. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic categorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for observation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear time-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for nonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly comprehensive nonlinear theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, revised version</p></details> |
| **[Generative Learning for Slow Manifolds and Bifurcation Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20375v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit. In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[A locking free multiscale method for linear elasticity in stress-displacement formulation with high contrast coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18054v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations for linear elasticity problems in high-contrast media poses a significant computational challenge. Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aerial Image Classification in Scarce and Unconstrained Environments via Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17655v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Benefits of Memory for Modeling Time-Dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02313v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.</p></details> |  |

While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUPRA: Subspace Parameterized Attention for Neural Operator on General Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15897v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators are efficient surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their key components face challenges: (1) in order to improve accuracy, attention mechanisms suffer from computational inefficiency on large-scale meshes, and (2) spectral convolutions rely on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on regular grids and assume a flat geometry, which causes accuracy degradation on irregular domains. To tackle these problems, we regard the matrix-vector operations in the standard attention mechanism on vectors in Euclidean space as bilinear forms and linear operators in vector spaces and generalize the attention mechanism to function spaces. This new attention mechanism is fully equivalent to the standard attention but impossible to compute due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces. To address this, inspired by model reduction techniques, we propose a Subspace Parameterized Attention (SUPRA) neural operator, which approximates the attention mechanism within a finite-dimensional subspace. To construct a subspace on irregular domains for SUPRA, we propose using the Laplacian eigenfunctions, which naturally adapt to domains' geometry and guarantee the optimal approximation for smooth functions. Experiments show that the SUPRA neural operator reduces error rates by up to 33% on various PDE datasets while maintaining state-of-the-art computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and inference in error-in-operator model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11834v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many statistical problems can be reduced to a linear inverse problem in which only a noisy version of the operator is available. Particular examples include random design regression, deconvolution problem, instrumental variable regression, functional data analysis, error-in-variable regression, drift estimation in stochastic diffusion, and many others. The pragmatic plug-in approach can be well justified in the classical asymptotic setup with a growing sample size. However, recent developments in high dimensional inference reveal some new features of this problem. In high dimensional linear regression with a random design, the plug-in approach is questionable but the use of a simple ridge penalization yields a benign overfitting phenomenon; see \cite{baLoLu2020}, \cite{ChMo2022}, \cite{NoPuSp2024}. This paper revisits the general Error-in-Operator problem for finite samples and high dimension of the source and image spaces. A particular focus is on the choice of a proper regularization. We show that a simple ridge penalty (Tikhonov regularization) works properly in the case when the operator is more regular than the signal. In the opposite case, some model reduction technique like spectral truncation should be applied.</p></details> |  |

A prominent contemporary example is from aerospace propulsion, where HPC is used for rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) simulations in support of the design of next-generation rocket engines; however, these simulations take millions of core hours even on powerful supercomputers, which makes them impractical for engineering tasks like design exploration and risk assessment. Data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) aim to address this limitation by constructing computationally cheap yet sufficiently accurate approximations that serve as surrogates for the high-fidelity model. This paper contributes a distributed memory algorithm that achieves fast and scalable construction of predictive physics-based ROMs trained from sparse datasets of extremely large state dimension. The algorithm learns structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets.This enables model reduction for problems at a scale and complexity that exceeds the capabilities of standard, serial approaches. We demonstrate our algorithm's scalability using up to $2,048$ cores on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We focus on a real-world three-dimensional RDRE for which one millisecond of simulated physical time requires one million core hours on a supercomputer. Using a training dataset of $2,536$ snapshots each of state dimension $76$ million, our distributed algorithm enables the construction of a predictive data-driven reduced model in just $13$ seconds on $2,048$ cores on Frontera.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Reduction of Linear Quadratic Output Systems in Finite Frequency Range](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07939v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In frequency-limited model order reduction, the objective is to maintain the frequency response of the original system within a specified frequency range in the reduced-order model. In this paper, a mathematical expression for the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is derived, which quantifies the error within the desired frequency interval. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the error are derived. The inherent difficulty in satisfying these conditions within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. Using the optimality conditions and the Petrov-Galerkin projection, a stationary point iteration algorithm is proposed, which approximately satisfies these optimality conditions upon convergence. The main computational effort in the proposed algorithm involves solving sparse-dense Sylvester equations. These equations are frequently encountered in $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction algorithms and can be solved efficiently. Moreover, the algorithm bypasses the requirement of matrix logarithm computation, which is typically necessary for most frequency-limited reduction methods and can be computationally demanding for high-order systems. An illustrative example is provided to numerically validate the developed theory. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness in accurately approximating the original high-order model within the specified frequency range is demonstrated through the reduction of an advection-diffusion equation-based model, commonly used in model reduction literature for testing algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm's computational efficiency is highlighted by successfully reducing a flexible space structure model of order one million.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpolatory model reduction of dynamical systems with root mean squared error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Balanced Truncation via Tangential Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13358v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the construction of rth-order truncated balanced realizations via tangential interpolation at r specified interpolation points. It is demonstrated that when the truncated Hankel singular values are negligible-that is, when the discarded states are nearly uncontrollable and unobservable-balanced truncation simplifies to a bi-tangential Hermite interpolation problem at r interpolation points. In such cases, the resulting truncated balanced realization is nearly H2-optimal and thus interpolates the original model at the mirror images of its poles along its residual directions. Like standard H2-optimal model reduction, where the interpolation points and tangential directions that yield a local optimum are not known, in balanced truncation as well, the interpolation points and tangential directions required to produce a truncated balanced realization remain unknown. To address this, we propose an iterative tangential interpolation-based algorithm for balanced truncation. Upon convergence, the algorithm yields a low-rank truncated balanced realization that accurately preserves the r largest Hankel singular values of the original system. An adaptive scheme to automatically select the order r of the reduced model is also proposed. The algorithm is fully automatic, choosing both the interpolation data and the model order without user intervention. Additionally, an adaptive low-rank solver for Lyapunov equations based on tangential interpolation is proposed, automatically selecting both the interpolation data and the rank without user intervention. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on benchmark models, confirming their efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Intrusive model order reduction techniques exhibit high accuracy levels, however, they are rarely used as a standalone industrial tool, because of the required high level knowledge involved in the construction and usage of these techniques. Moreover, the computation time benefit is compromised for highly nonlinear problems. On the other hand, non-intrusive methods often struggle with accuracy in nonlinear cases, typically requiring a large design of experiment and a large number of snapshots achieve a reliable performance. However, generating the stiffness matrix in a non-intrusive approach presents an optimal way to align accuracy with efficiency, allying the advantages of both intrusive and non-intrusive methods.This work introduces a lightly intrusive model order reduction technique that employs machine learning within a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition framework to achieve this alliance. By leveraging outputs from commercial full-order models, this method constructs a reduced-order model that operates effectively without requiring expert user intervention. The proposed technique has the possibility to approximate linear non affine as well as non linear terms. It is showcased for linear and nonlinear structural mechanics problems.</p></details> |  |

However, standard inference for these models has the typical cubic scaling, and common scalable approximation schemes for GPs cannot be applied since the covariance function is non-continuous. In this work, we derive a basis function approximation scheme for mixed-domain covariance functions, which scales linearly with respect to the number of observations and total number of basis functions. The proposed approach is naturally applicable to also Bayesian GP regression with discrete observation models. We demonstrate the scalability of the approach and compare model reduction techniques for additive GP models in a longitudinal data context. We confirm that we can approximate the exact GP model accurately in a fraction of the runtime compared to fitting the corresponding exact model. In addition, we demonstrate a scalable model reduction workflow for obtaining smaller and more interpretable models when dealing with a large number of candidate predictors.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we further investigate them from two different perspectives. First, we establish novel connections between these differential energy functions and their incremental counterparts by assuming the existence of the corresponding optimal state feedback for each controllability function. Specifically, an upper bound on the incremental controllability/observability function is provided by the corresponding differential energy function. Conversely, an upper bound on the differential controllability function can be estimated from the incremental controllability function. Furthermore, the differential observability function can be constructed from the incremental observability function. Second, we explore the positive definiteness of the differential controllability/observability function in the context of controllability/observability and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validation and Calibration of Energy Models with Real Vehicle Data from Chassis Dynamometer Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21057v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of vehicle fuel consumption typically requires detailed modeling of complex internal powertrain dynamics, often resulting in computationally intensive simulations. However, many transportation applications-such as traffic flow modeling, optimization, and control-require simplified models that are fast, interpretable, and easy to implement, while still maintaining fidelity to physical energy behavior. This work builds upon a recently developed model reduction pipeline that derives physics-like energy models from high-fidelity Autonomie vehicle simulations. These reduced models preserve essential vehicle dynamics, enabling realistic fuel consumption estimation with minimal computational overhead. While the reduced models have demonstrated strong agreement with their Autonomie counterparts, previous validation efforts have been confined to simulation environments. This study extends the validation by comparing the reduced energy model's outputs against real-world vehicle data. Focusing on the MidSUV category, we tune the baseline Autonomie model to closely replicate the characteristics of a Toyota RAV4. We then assess the accuracy of the resulting reduced model in estimating fuel consumption under actual drive conditions. Our findings suggest that, when the reference Autonomie model is properly calibrated, the simplified model produced by the reduction pipeline can provide reliable, semi-principled fuel rate estimates suitable for large-scale transportation applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model reduction of convection-dominated viscous conservation laws using implicit feature tracking and landmark image registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17463v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) remain generally unreliable for convection-dominated problems, such as those encountered in hypersonic flows, due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of linear subspace approximations, known as the Kolmogorov barrier. This limitation hinders the accuracy of traditional ROMs and necessitates impractical amounts of training data during the offline phase. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel landmark-based registration procedure tailored for ROMs of convection-dominated problems. Our approach leverages limited training data and incorporates a nonlinear transformation of the data using a landmark-based registration technique combined with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. During the offline phase, we align dominant convective features in a reference domain, resulting in a rapid decay of error relative to the reduced space dimension. Landmarks are generated through a three-step process: (1) detecting shocks via edge detection techniques, (2) sampling using Monte Carlo methods, and (3) domain partitioning with $k$-means clustering, where cluster centroids serve as landmarks. Accurate landmark correspondence is achieved by minimizing pairing distances for similar features. The online phase integrates standard minimum-residual ROM methodologies, extending the optimization space to include admissible domain mappings. We validate our approach on two test cases: a space-time Burgers' equation parameterized by the initial condition, and a hypersonic viscous flow over a cylinder parameterized by the Mach number. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in overcoming the Kolmogorov barrier and enhancing the reliability of ROMs for convection-dominated problems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version (note that title changed from previous version)</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian learning with Gaussian processes for low-dimensional representations of time-dependent nonlinear systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03455v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a data-driven method for learning low-dimensional time-dependent physics-based surrogate models whose predictions are endowed with uncertainty estimates. We use the operator inference approach to model reduction that poses the problem of learning low-dimensional model terms as a regression of state space data and corresponding time derivatives by minimizing the residual of reduced system equations. Standard operator inference models perform well with accurate training data that are dense in time, but producing stable and accurate models when the state data are noisy and/or sparse in time remains a challenge. Another challenge is the lack of uncertainty estimation for the predictions from the operator inference models. Our approach addresses these challenges by incorporating Gaussian process surrogates into the operator inference framework to (1) probabilistically describe uncertainties in the state predictions and (2) procure analytical time derivative estimates with quantified uncertainties. The formulation leads to a generalized least-squares regression and, ultimately, reduced-order models that are described probabilistically with a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution of the operators. The resulting probabilistic surrogate model propagates uncertainties from the observed state data to reduced-order predictions. We demonstrate the method is effective for constructing low-dimensional models of two nonlinear partial differential equations representing a compressible flow and a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, as well as for estimating the parameters of a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing compartmental models in epidemiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Sandialabs/GP-BayesOpInf</p></details> |

However, practical model checking requires input models of manageable size. In this paper, we extend the model reduction method by variable-based abstraction, proposed recently by Jamroga and Kim, to the verification of real-time systems and properties. To this end, we define a real-time extension of MAS graphs, extend the abstraction procedure, and prove its correctness for the universal fragment of Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL). Besides estimating the theoretical complexity gains, we present an experimental evaluation for a simplified model of the Estonian voting system and verification using the Uppaal model checker.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Model Reductions for the Boundary Feedback Stabilization of Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07492v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetizable piezoelectric beams exhibit strong couplings between mechanical, electric, and magnetic fields, significantly affecting their high-frequency vibrational behavior. Ensuring exponential stability under boundary feedback controllers is challenging due to the uneven distribution of high-frequency eigenvalues in standard Finite Difference models. While numerical filtering can mitigate instability as the discretization parameter tends to zero, its reliance on explicit spectral computations is computationally demanding. This work introduces two novel model reduction techniques for stabilizing magnetizable piezoelectric beams. First, a Finite Element discretization using linear splines is developed, improving numerical stability over standard Finite Differences. However, this method still requires numerical filtering to eliminate spurious high-frequency modes, necessitating full spectral decomposition. Numerical investigations further reveal a direct dependence of the optimal filtering threshold on feedback amplifiers. To overcome these limitations, an alternative order-reduction Finite Difference scheme is proposed, eliminating the need for numerical filtering. Using a Lyapunov-based framework, we establish exponential stability with decay rates independent of the discretization parameter. The reduced model also exhibits exponential error decay and uniform energy convergence to the original system. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and we construct an algorithm for separating eigenpairs for the proper application of the numerical filtering. Comparative spectral analyses and energy decay results confirm the superior stability and efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a robust framework for model reduction in coupled partial differential equation systems.</p></details> | 11 figures, 3 tables |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Model Reduction by Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00768v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel non-linear model reduction method: Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition (PMD), which provides a powerful framework for constructing non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) by embedding a high-dimensional system into a low-dimensional probabilistic manifold and predicting the dynamics. Through explicit mappings, PMD captures both linearity and non-linearity of the system. A key strength of PMD lies in its predictive capabilities, allowing it to generate stable dynamic states based on embedded representations. The method also offers a mathematically rigorous approach to analyze the convergence of linear feature matrices and low-dimensional probabilistic manifolds, ensuring that sample-based approximations converge to the true data distributions as sample sizes increase. These properties, combined with its computational efficiency, make PMD a versatile tool for applications requiring high accuracy and scalability, such as fluid dynamics simulations and other engineering problems. By preserving the geometric and probabilistic structures of the high-dimensional system, PMD achieves a balance between computational speed, accuracy, and predictive capabilities, positioning itself as a robust alternative to the traditional model reduction method.</p></details> | 22pages, 64figures |

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |

We develop interpretable and non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) capable of capturing dynamics associated with bifurcations by identifying a minimal set of coordinates. Our methodology combines the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method with a deep learning framework based on Autoencoder (AE) architectures. To enhance dimensionality reduction, we integrate a nested Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with the SINDy-AE architecture. This novel combination enables a sparse discovery of system dynamics while maintaining efficiency of the reduced model. We demonstrate our approach via two challenging test cases defined on sudden-expansion channel geometries: a symmetry-breaking bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation. Starting from a comprehensive analysis of their high-fidelity behavior, i.e. symmetry-breaking phenomena and the rise of unsteady periodic solutions, we validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our ROMs. The results show successful reconstruction of the bifurcations, accurate prediction of system evolution for unseen parameter values, and significant speed-up compared to full-order methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Image Reparameterisation: A Unified Approach to Structural and Practical Identifiability and Model Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04867v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both structural and practical parameter non-identifiability present fundamental challenges when using mathematical models to interpret data. This issue is particularly acute in complex, applied areas such as the life sciences or engineering, where determining appropriate model complexity is challenging. While several approaches exist for diagnosing and resolving parameter non-identifiability, including symbolic methods, profile likelihood analysis, and sloppiness analysis, these approaches have distinct limitations and are rarely combined. We present an integrated approach called Invariant Image Reparameterisation (IIR) that incorporates key elements of these methods in a new way. Our approach replaces symbolic computations with numerical calculations at a single reference estimate and an invariance condition that determines when this local calculation holds globally. Parameter combinations determined by this method are naturally ordered by degree of identifiability, and this supports model reduction by replacing a practically non-identified model with a structurally non-identified approximate model. This approximate model can be further parameterised in terms of identified parameters only. By treating parameter combinations determined by our approach as interest parameters within our established likelihood-based Profile-Wise Analysis (PWA) framework, we incorporate uncertainty quantification in terms of likelihood profiles and confidence sets. We provide a Julia library on GitHub (https://github.com/omaclaren/reparam) demonstrating our methodology across a range of mathematical models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages + supplementary material</p></details> |

After truncating the series, we introduce the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to approximate the resulting parametric EVP. We then use the quasi-Monte Carlo (qMC) method to calculate empirical statistics within a finite-dimensional random space. Furthermore, using a set of low-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis functions, the referred degrees of freedoms for constructing multiscale basis are independent of the spatial mesh. Given the bounded assumption on the random potentials, we then derive and prove an error estimate for the proposed method. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the error estimate. In addition, we investigate the localization of eigenfunctions for the Schr\"odinger operator with spatially random potentials. The results show that our method provides a practical and efficient solution for simulating complex quantum systems governed by semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphHash: Graph Clustering Enables Parameter Efficiency in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17245v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep recommender systems rely heavily on large embedding tables to handle high-cardinality categorical features such as user/item identifiers, and face significant memory constraints at scale. To tackle this challenge, hashing techniques are often employed to map multiple entities to the same embedding and thus reduce the size of the embedding tables. Concurrently, graph-based collaborative signals have emerged as powerful tools in recommender systems, yet their potential for optimizing embedding table reduction remains unexplored. This paper introduces GraphHash, the first graph-based approach that leverages modularity-based bipartite graph clustering on user-item interaction graphs to reduce embedding table sizes. We demonstrate that the modularity objective has a theoretical connection to message-passing, which provides a foundation for our method. By employing fast clustering algorithms, GraphHash serves as a computationally efficient proxy for message-passing during preprocessing and a plug-and-play graph-based alternative to traditional ID hashing. Extensive experiments show that GraphHash substantially outperforms diverse hashing baselines on both retrieval and click-through-rate prediction tasks. In particular, GraphHash achieves on average a 101.52% improvement in recall when reducing the embedding table size by more than 75%, highlighting the value of graph-based collaborative information for model reduction.

The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Collocation Point Strategies For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700v4)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose two adaptive collocation point selection strategies utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approaches improve PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</p></details> |  |

The approach begins with the introduction of innovative monolithic and global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithms, which incorporate the backward differentiation formulas for time discretization. In each iteration, these algorithms involve solving a diffusion subproblem over the entire temporal domain, followed by solving a generalized Stokes subproblem over the same time interval. To accelerate the global-in-time iterative process, we present a reduced order modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition, aimed at reducing the primary computational cost from the generalized Stokes subproblem. The effectiveness of this novel method is validated both theoretically and through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Using push-forward maps and Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow, we reformulate the TDSE as a Hamiltonian system in terms of push-forward maps. The new formulation can be viewed as a generative model in the Wasserstein space, which is a manifold of probability density functions. Then we parameterize the push-forward maps by reduce-order models such as neural networks. This induces a new metric in the parameter space by pulling back the Wasserstein metric on density manifold, which further results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters of the reduce-order model. Leveraging the computational techniques from deep learning, such as Neural ODE, we design an algorithm to solve the TDSE in the parameterized push-forward map space, which provides an alternative approach with the potential to scale up to high-dimensional problems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.</p></details> |  |

The method integrates a novel algorithm with Pareto front analysis to construct a compact, high-fidelity reduced-order model that balances accuracy and efficiency. An explainable NLARX deep learning framework enables real-time, adaptive calibration and prediction, while a key innovation-computing orthogonal Koopman modes via randomized orthogonal projections-ensures optimal data representation. This approach for data-driven twin modeling is fully self-consistent, avoiding heuristic choices and enhancing interpretability through integrated explainable learning techniques. The proposed method is demonstrated on shock wave phenomena using three experiments of increasing complexity, accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the resulting data-driven twin models.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing material behavior discovery using embedding-oriented Physically-Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00959v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</p></details> |  |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Continuous- and Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18131v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse scattering for Schrödinger equation in the frequency domain via data-driven reduced order modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11034v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we develop a numerical method for solving an inverse scattering problem of estimating the scattering potential in a Schr\"{o}dinger equation from frequency domain measurements based on reduced order models (ROM). The ROM is a projection of Schr\"{o}dinger operator onto a subspace spanned by its solution snapshots at certain wavenumbers. Provided the measurements are performed at these wavenumbers, the ROM can be constructed in a data-driven manner from the measurements on a surface surrounding the scatterers. Once the ROM is computed, the scattering potential can be estimated using non-linear optimization that minimizes the ROM misfit. Such an approach typically outperforms the conventional methods based on data misfit minimization. We develop two variants of ROM-based algorithms for inverse scattering and test them on a synthetic example in two spatial dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers based on an ALE approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13613v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a Galerkin projection-based reduced-order modelling (ROM) approach for segregated fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, formulated within an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework at low Reynolds numbers using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is constructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and incorporates a data-driven technique that combines classical Galerkin projection with radial basis function (RBF) networks. The results demonstrate the numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed method relative to the high-fidelity model. The ROM successfully captures transient flow fields and, importantly, the forces acting on the moving structure without exhibiting unphysical growth or divergence over time. This is further supported by the bounded evolution of error metrics and physical observables, which remain consistent with the full-order simulations throughout the prediction horizon. The method's effectiveness is validated through a benchmark vortex-induced vibration (VIV) case involving a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=200. The hybrid ROM approach yields an accurate and efficient tool for solving FSI problems involving mesh motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow singular value decay. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method, but with a data-driven basis. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying the space-local POD, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions compared to standard POD, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method. Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D and 2D advection equation. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, source code can be found at https://github.com/tobyvg/local_POD_overlap.jl</p></details> |
| **[Blending data and physics for reduced-order modeling of systems with spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21299v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is memory all you need? Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Reduced-Order Models for Port-Hamiltonian Systems with Operator Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02183v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian operator inference has been developed in [Sharma, H., Wang, Z., Kramer, B., Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 431, p.133122, 2022] to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models (ROMs) for Hamiltonian systems. The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |
| **[Adaptive Reduced Basis Trust Region Methods for Parabolic Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11130v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider nonlinear inverse problems arising in the context of parameter identification for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). For stable reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems. The implementation is made available for reproducibility and further use.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

For both the continuous and the discrete (finite element) settings, we prove that the new strategy yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers that were not covered by current results. We also show that the new feedback control yields more accurate results than the current control approaches in marginally-resolved numerical simulations of a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=1000$. We note, however, that for realistic control parameters, the stabilizing effect of the new feedback control strategy is not sufficient in the convection-dominated regime. Our second contribution is the development of an adaptive evolve-filter-relax (aEFR) regularization that stabilizes marginally-resolved simulations in the convection-dominated regime and increases the accuracy of the new feedback control in realistic parameter settings. For the finite element setting, we prove that the novel feedback control equipped with the new aEFR method yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, our numerical investigation shows that the new strategy yields accurate results for reduced order models that dramatically decrease the size of the feedback control problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors. The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively. Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder QR. For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for highly ill-conditioned matrices. The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments on a laptop and computation server.</p></details> | Preprint |

The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

The evaluation of objective and constraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used to explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models are sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control problem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions requires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE). The models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the Boussinesq PDE.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 17 figures, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Large-Scale Linear Parameter Varying Systems with Dynamic Mode Decomposition Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02336v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems are a well-established class of nonlinear systems with a rich theory for stability analysis, control, and analytical response finding, among other aspects. Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 9 figures.

| **[An Adaptive Port Technique for Synthesising Rotational Components in Component Modal Synthesis Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03276v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Component Modal Synthesis (CMS) is a reduced order modelling method widely used for large-scale complex systems. It can effectively approximate system-level models through component synthesis, in which the repetitive geometrical components are modelled once and synthesised together. However, the conventional CMS only applies to systems with stationary components connected by strictly compatible ports, limiting it from modelling systems with moving components. This paper presents an adaptive port (AP) technique to extend CMS approaches for modelling parametric systems with rotational parts. To demonstrate the capability of the AP technique, we apply it to the Static Condensation Reduced Basis Element (SCRBE), one widely used variant of CMS approaches. The AP-based SCRBE (AP-SCRBE) can enforce the synthesis of rotational-stationary components over a shared adaptive port when the connecting surfaces of two components are discretisation-wise incompatible, which happens when one component moves relative to the others. Numerical experiments on the NREL 5MW wind turbine show that, in the context of rotational-stationary component synthesis, the AP-SCRBE can accurately and efficiently model the rotating rotor with pitch rotation of blades. It can produce almost identical results to a high-fidelity finite element model at two to three orders faster speeds.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.</p></details> | <details><summary>artic...</summary><p>article, 49 pages, 29 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[High order global flux schemes for general steady state preservation of shallow water moment equations with non-conservative products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00573v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow water moment equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that allow to represent vertical variations of the velocity profile at the expense of additional evolution equations for a number of additional variables, so called moments. This introduces non-linear non-conservative products in the system, which make the analytical characterization of steady states much harder if not impossible. The lack of analytical steady states poses a challenge for the design of well-balanced schemes, which aim at preserving such steady states as crucial in many applications. In this work, we present a family of fully well-balanced, high-order WENO finite volume methods for general hyperbolic balance laws with non-conservative products like the shallow water moment equations, for which no analytical steady states are available. The schemes are based on the flux globalization approach, in which both source terms and non-conservative products are integrated with a tailored high order quadrature in the divergence term. The resulting global flux is then reconstructed instead of the conservative variables to preserve all steady states. Numerical tests show the optimal convergence of the method and a significant error reduction for steady state solutions. Furthermore, we provide a numerical comparison of perturbed steady states for different families of shallow water moment equations, which illustrates the flexibility of our method that is valid for general equations without prior knowledge of steady states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Physics-Based Li-ion Battery Model via Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Learning and Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00353v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |

The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems. Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate normal-forms for the numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of navier-stokes flows via machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21275v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate how the embed-learn-lift framework enables the construction of surrogate normal-forms, namely minimal-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs), from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations. These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Exact operator inference with minimal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01244v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel method to generate snapshot data for operator inference that guarantees the exact reconstruction of intrusive projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs). To ensure exact reconstruction, the operator inference least squares matrix must have full rank, without regularization. Existing works have achieved this full rank using heuristic strategies to generate snapshot data and a-posteriori checks on full rank, but without a guarantee of success. Our novel snapshot data generation method provides this guarantee thanks to two key ingredients: first we identify ROM states that induce full rank, then we generate snapshots corresponding to exactly these states by simulating multiple trajectories for only a single time step. This way, the number of required snapshots is minimal and orders of magnitude lower than typically reported with existing methods. The method avoids non-Markovian terms and does not require re-projection. Since the number of snapshots is minimal, the least squares problem simplifies to a linear system that is numerically more stable. In addition, because the inferred operators are exact, properties of the intrusive ROM operators such as symmetry or skew-symmetry are preserved. Numerical results for differential equations involving 2nd, 3rd and 8th order polynomials demonstrate that the novel snapshot data generation method leads to exact reconstruction of the intrusive reduced order models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Reduced-order modeling for Ablowitz-Ladik equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11130v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, reduced-order models (ROMs) are constructed for the Ablowitz-Ladik equation (ALE), an integrable semi-discretization of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) with and without damping. Both ALEs are non-canonical conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems with the Poisson matrix depending quadratically on the state variables, and with quadratic Hamiltonian. The full-order solutions are obtained with the energy preserving midpoint rule for the conservative ALE and exponential midpoint rule for the dissipative ALE. The reduced-order solutions are constructed intrusively by preserving the skew-symmetric structure of the reduced non-canonical Hamiltonian system by applying proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the Galerkin projection. For an efficient offline-online decomposition of the ROMs, the quadratic nonlinear terms of the Poisson matrix are approximated by the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The computation of the reduced-order solutions is further accelerated by the use of tensor techniques. Preservation of the Hamiltonian and momentum for the conservative ALE, and preservation of dissipation properties of the dissipative ALE, guarantee the long-term stability of soliton solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Lagrangian Neural Networks for Infinite Horizon Planning in Quadrupedal Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16079v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system, enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion. This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3) full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control. These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at Advances in Robotics (AIR) Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Particle in Cell method for the Vlasov-Poisson system using auto-encoder and Hamiltonian neural](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15203v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian particle-based simulations of plasma dynamics are inherently computationally intensive, primarily due to the large number of particles required to obtain accurate solutions. This challenge becomes even more acute in many-query contexts, where numerous simulations must be conducted across a range of time and parameter values. Consequently, it is essential to construct reduced order models from such discretizations to significantly lower computational costs while ensuring validity across the specified time and parameter domains. Preserving the Hamiltonian structure in these reduced models is also crucial, as it helps maintain long-term stability. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear, non-intrusive, data-driven model order reduction method for the 1D-1V Vlasov--Poisson system, discretized using a Hamiltonian Particle-In-Cell scheme. Our approach relies on a two-step projection framework: an initial linear projection based on the Proper Symplectic Decomposition, followed by a nonlinear projection learned via an autoencoder neural network. The reduced dynamics are then modeled using a Hamiltonian neural network. The offline phase of the method is split into two stages: first, constructing the linear projection using full-order model snapshots; second, jointly training the autoencoder and the Hamiltonian neural network to simultaneously learn the encoder-decoder mappings and the reduced dynamics. We validate the proposed method on several benchmarks, including Landau damping and two-stream instability. The results show that our method has better reduction properties than standard linear Hamiltonian reduction methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using BDF schemes in the temporal integration of POD-ROM methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14543v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of a semilinear reaction-diffusion model problem (PDEs) by means of reduced order methods (ROMs) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We focus on the time integration of the fully discrete reduced order model. Most of the analysis in the literature has been carried out for the implicit Euler method as time integrator. We integrate in time the reduced order model with the BDF-q time stepping ($1\le q\le 5$) and prove optimal rate of convergence of order $q$ in time. Our set of snapshots is obtained from finite element approximations to the original model problem computed at different times. These finite element approximations can be obtained with any time integrator. The POD method is based on first order difference quotients of the snapshots. The reason for doing this is twofold. On the one hand, the use of difference quotients allow us to provide pointwise-in-time error bounds. On the other, the use of difference quotients is essential to get the expected rate $q$ in time since we apply that the BDF-q time stepping, $1\le q\le 5$, can be written as a linear combination of first order difference quotients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual guidance: ROM-informed field reconstruction with generative models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13369v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a dual-guided framework for reconstructing unsteady incompressible flow fields using sparse observations. The approach combines optimized sensor placement with a physics-informed guided generative model. Sensor locations are selected using mutual information theory applied to a reduced-order model of the flow, enabling efficient identification of high-information observation points with minimal computational cost. These sensors, once selected, provide targeted observations that guide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model conditioned by physical constraints. Extensive experiments on 2D laminar cylinder wake flows demonstrate that under sparse sensing conditions, the structured sensor layouts fail to capture key flow dynamics, yielding high reconstruction errors. In contrast, our optimized sensor placement strategy achieves accurate reconstructions with L2 errors as low as 0.05, even with a limited number of sensors, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-limited regimes. When the number of sensors is higher than a threshold, however, both methods perform comparably. Our dual-guided approach bridges reduced order model-based sensor position optimization with modern generative modeling, providing accurate, physics-consistent reconstruction from sparse data for scientific machine-learning problems.</p></details> |  |

The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages (31 pages of main text and Appendix, 5 of Supplement), 8 Figures (6 in the main text and Appendix and 2 in the Supplement)</p></details> |

Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance, we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the importance of model design and initialization.</p></details> | 28 pages, 10 figures |

However, solvers can be computationally expensive, leading to the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the training data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This allows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional ODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous problems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing training data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space, particularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several autoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns to correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with small autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while also reducing training time compared to LaSDI.</p></details> |  |

These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

In this method, we combine three strategies to reduce the computing time to solve NSE: time splitting, reduction of the computational domain through non-standard treatment of open boundary conditions and reduced order modelling. To make the work self-contained, we first present the formulation of the time-splitting scheme applied to the Navier-Stokes equations with open boundary conditions, employing a first-order Euler time discretization and deriving the non-standard boundary condition for pressure. Then, we construct a Galerkin projection-based ROM using POD with two different treatments of the pressure boundary condition on the outlet. We propose a comparative performance analysis between the standard projection-based POD-ROM (fully intrusive) and a hybrid POD-ROM that combines a projection-based approach (intrusive) with a data-driven technique (non-intrusive) using Radial Basis Functions (RBF). We illustrate this comparison through two different numerical tests: the flow in a bifurcated tube and the benchmark numerical test of the flow past cylinder, numerically investigating the efficiency and accuracy of both ROMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing non-intrusive approaches approximate the dynamics of a reduced-order model (ROM) by solving a data-driven least-squares regression problem for low-dimensional matrix operators. Our approach instead leverages regularized kernel interpolation, which yields an optimal approximation of the ROM dynamics from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that our kernel-based approach can produce interpretable ROMs whose structure mirrors full-order model structure by embedding judiciously chosen feature maps into the kernel. The approach is flexible and allows a combination of informed structure through feature maps and closure terms via more general nonlinear terms in the kernel. We also derive a computable a posteriori error bound that combines standard error estimates for intrusive projection-based ROMs and kernel interpolants. The approach is demonstrated in several numerical experiments that include comparisons to operator inference using both proper orthogonal decomposition and quadratic manifold dimension reduction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a new approach for the structured data-driven surrogate modeling of linear dynamical systems described by second-order time derivatives via balanced truncation model-order reduction. The proposed method is a data-driven reformulation of position-velocity balanced truncation for second-order systems and generalizes the quadrature-based balanced truncation for unstructured first-order systems to the second-order case. The computed surrogates encode a generalized proportional damping structure, and the damping coefficients are inferred solely from data by minimizing a least-squares error over the coefficients. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In particular, we focus on ROMs built using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) in an under-resolved and marginally-resolved regime, i.e. when the number of modes employed is not enough to capture the system dynamics. We propose a method to re-introduce the contribution of neglected modes through a quadratic correction term, given by the action of a quadratic operator on the POD coefficients. Differently from the state-of-the-art methodologies, where the operator is learned via least-squares optimisation, we propose to parametrise the operator by a Multi-Input Operators Network (MIONet). This way, we are able to build models with higher generalisation capabilities, where the operator itself is continuous in space -- thus agnostic of the domain discretisation -- and parameter-dependent. We test our model on two standard benchmarks in fluid dynamics and show that the correction term improves the accuracy of standard POD-based ROMs.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Generative Models for Parameter Space Reduction applied to Reduced Order Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09721v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving and optimising Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in geometrically parameterised domains often requires iterative methods, leading to high computational and time complexities. One potential solution is to learn a direct mapping from the parameters to the PDE solution. Two prominent methods for this are Data-driven Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models (DROMs) and Parametrised Physics Informed Neural Networks (PPINNs). However, their accuracy tends to degrade as the number of geometric parameters increases. To address this, we propose adopting Generative Models to create new geometries, effectively reducing the number of parameters, and improving the performance of DROMs and PPINNs. The first section briefly reviews the general theory of Generative Models and provides some examples, whereas the second focusses on their application to geometries with fixed or variable points, emphasising their integration with DROMs and PPINNs. DROMs trained on geometries generated by these models demonstrate enhanced accuracy due to reduced parameter dimensionality. For PPINNs, we introduce a methodology that leverages Generative Models to reduce the parameter dimensions and improve convergence. This approach is tested on a Poisson equation defined over deformed Stanford Bunny domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Thermodynamically Consistent Latent Dynamics Identification for Parametric Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08475v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics identification (tLaSDI) framework for the reduced-order modeling of parametric nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers' equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost. Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic behavior of the system, offering valuable insights into the physical-space dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Galerkin Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Flows with Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03694v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Galerkin-based reduced-order models (G-ROMs) offer efficient and accurate approximations for laminar flows but require hundreds to thousands of modes $N$ to capture the complex dynamics of turbulent flows. This makes standard G-ROMs computationally expensive due to the third-order advection tensor contraction, requiring the storage of $N^3$ entries and the computation of $2N^3$ operations per timestep. As a result, such ROMs are impractical for realistic applications like turbulent flow control. In this work, we consider problems that demand large $N$ values for accurate G-ROMs and propose a novel approach that accelerates G-ROMs by utilizing the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition to approximate the advection tensor as a sum of $R$ rank-1 tensors. We also leverage the partial skew-symmetry property of the advection tensor and derive two conditions for the CP decomposition to preserve this property. Moreover, we investigate the low-rank structure of the advection tensor using singular value decomposition (SVD) and compare the performance of G-ROMs accelerated by CP (CPD-ROM) and SVD (SVD-ROM). Demonstrated on problems from 2D periodic to 3D turbulent flows, the CPD-ROM achieves at least a $10$-fold speedup and a $16.7$-fold reduction in nonlinear term evaluation costs compared to the standard G-ROM. The skew-symmetry preserving CPD-ROM demonstrates improved stability in both the reproduction and predictive regimes, and enables the use of smaller rank $R$. Singular value analysis reveals a persistent low-rank structure in the $H^1_0$-based advection tensor, and CP decomposition achieves at least an order of magnitude higher compression ratio than SVD.</p></details> | 25 pages, 19 figures |

| **[A Data-Based Architecture for Flight Test without Test Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02315v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The justification for the "test point" derives from the test pilot's obligation to reproduce faithfully the pre-specified conditions of some model prediction. Pilot deviation from those conditions invalidates the model assumptions. Flight test aids have been proposed to increase accuracy on more challenging test points. However, the very existence of databands and tolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We propose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a high-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to generate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can generate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second, if the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can be updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM at whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the high-fidelity model. We present a single example of this "point-less" architecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft model to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface.

| **[Automated Manifold Learning for Reduced Order Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01741v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of identifying geometric structure in data is a cornerstone of (unsupervised) learning. As a result, Geometric Representation Learning has been widely applied across scientific and engineering domains. In this work, we investigate the use of Geometric Representation Learning for the data-driven discovery of system dynamics from spatial-temporal data. We propose to encode similarity structure in such data in a spatial-temporal proximity graph, to which we apply a range of classical and deep learning-based manifold learning approaches to learn reduced order dynamics. We observe that while manifold learning is generally capable of recovering reduced order dynamics, the quality of the learned representations varies substantially across different algorithms and hyperparameter choices. This is indicative of high sensitivity to the inherent geometric assumptions of the respective approaches and suggests a need for careful hyperparameter tuning, which can be expensive in practise. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Manifold Learning, which selects a manifold learning approach and corresponding hyperparameter choices based on representative subsamples of the input graph. We demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to performance gains both in scalability and in the learned representations' accuracy in capturing local and global geometric features of the underlying system dynamics.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

The strategy is based on (i) a mathematical model of a convection-dominated problem coupling thermal convection and turbulence, and (ii) a least-squares approach for solving the inverse data assimilation problem, regularized by projecting the governing dynamics onto a reduced-order model (ROM). The unsteady freezing process considers a salmon slice in a freezer cabinet, modeled with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties. The forward problem is approximated using a third-order WENO finite volume solver, including an optimized second-order backward scheme for time discretization. We employ our data assimilation framework to reconstruct the temperature field based on a limited number of sensors and to estimate temperature distributions within frozen food. Sensor placement is optimized using a novel greedy algorithm, which maximizes the observability of the reduced-order dynamics for a fixed set of sensors. The proposed approach allows efficient extrapolation from external sensor measurements to the internal temperature of the food under realistic turbulent flow conditions, which is crucial for maintaining food quality.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Review On Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Lyapunov and Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09128v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>pages...</summary><p>pages - 19, figures - 9, Submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Bio-Inspired Artificial Neural Networks based on Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08762v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely on a global error signal generated at the network's output. In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly. Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information. Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle, linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty. This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC, focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter (KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python examples using PyTorch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Certificate Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05510v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of verifying different properties of discrete time dynamical systems, namely, reachability, safety and reach-while-avoid. To achieve this, we adopt a data driven perspective and, using past system trajectories as data, we aim at learning a specific function termed certificate for each property we wish to verify. We seek to minimize a loss function, designed to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode the satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we quantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it is for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be satisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the training data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use recent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable generalization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a novel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a certificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression, which is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees. This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general non-convex optimization problems. We verify the efficacy of our methodology on several numerical case studies, and compare it (both theoretically and numerically) with closely related results on data-driven property verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, submitted to Automatica</p></details> |
| **[Identifiability of linear stochastic state-space models with application to ecology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08714v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models are dynamical systems defined by a latent and an observed process. In ecology, stochastic state-space models in discrete time are most often used to describe the imperfectly observed dynamics of population sizes or animal movement. However, several studies have observed identifiability issues when state-space models are fitted to simulated or real data, and it is not currently clear whether those are due to data limitations or more fundamental model non-identifiability. To investigate such theoretical identifiability, a suitable exhaustive summary is required, defined as a vector of parameter combinations which fully determines the model. Previous work on exhaustive summaries has used expectations of the stochastic process, so that noise parameters are unaccounted for. In this paper, we build an exhaustive summary using the spectral density of the observed process, which fully accounts for all mean and variance parameters. This diagnostic is applied to contrasted ecological models and we show that they are generally theoretically identifiable, unless some model compartements are unobserved. This suggest that issues encountered while fitting models are mostly due to practical identifiability.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Judge or not to Judge: Using LLM Judgements for Advertiser Keyphrase Relevance at eBay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04209v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Optimal Statistical Inference in Noisy Linear Quadratic Reinforcement Learning over a Finite Horizon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08436v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Reinforcement learning have significantly enhanced sequential decision-making in uncertain environments. Despite their strong performance guarantees, most existing work has focused primarily on improving the operational accuracy of learned control policies and the convergence rates of learning algorithms, with comparatively little attention to uncertainty quantification and statistical inference. Yet, these aspects are essential for assessing the reliability and variability of control policies, especially in high-stakes applications. In this paper, we study statistical inference for the policy gradient (PG) method for noisy Linear Quadratic Reinforcement learning (LQ RL) over a finite time horizon, where linear dynamics with both known and unknown drift parameters are controlled subject to a quadratic cost. We establish the theoretical foundations for statistical inference in LQ RL, deriving exact asymptotics for both the PG estimators and the corresponding objective loss. Furthermore, we introduce a principled inference framework that leverages online bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals for both the learned optimal policy and the corresponding objective losses. The method updates the PG estimates along with a set of randomly perturbed PG estimates as new observations arrive. We prove that the proposed bootstrapping procedure is distributionally consistent and that the resulting confidence intervals achieve both asymptotic and non-asymptotic validity. Notably, our results imply that the quantiles of the exact distribution can be approximated at a rate of $n^{-1/4}$, where $n$ is the number of samples used during the procedure. The proposed procedure is easy to implement and applicable to both offline and fully online settings. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of noisy linear dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elastic Motion Policy: An Adaptive Dynamical System for Robust and Efficient One-Shot Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08029v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior cloning (BC) has become a staple imitation learning paradigm in robotics due to its ease of teaching robots complex skills directly from expert demonstrations. However, BC suffers from an inherent generalization issue. To solve this, the status quo solution is to gather more data. Yet, regardless of how much training data is available, out-of-distribution performance is still sub-par, lacks any formal guarantee of convergence and success, and is incapable of allowing and recovering from physical interactions with humans. These are critical flaws when robots are deployed in ever-changing human-centric environments. Thus, we propose Elastic Motion Policy (EMP), a one-shot imitation learning framework that allows robots to adjust their behavior based on the scene change while respecting the task specification. Trained from a single demonstration, EMP follows the dynamical systems paradigm where motion planning and control are governed by first-order differential equations with convergence guarantees. We leverage Laplacian editing in full end-effector space, $\mathbb{R}^3\times SO(3)$, and online convex learning of Lyapunov functions, to adapt EMP online to new contexts, avoiding the need to collect new demonstrations. We extensively validate our framework in real robot experiments, demonstrating its robust and efficient performance in dynamic environments, with obstacle avoidance and multi-step task capabilities.

| **[ADAM-SINDy: An Efficient Optimization Framework for Parameterized Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16528v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic dynamics learning with state-space systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07876v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property (ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality, stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Continuous Non-Conservative Dynamical Systems in SO(3)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07775v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1) unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and various real-world settings.

| **[Fast and Accurate Emulation of Complex Dynamic Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20250v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic simulators are computational models governed by differential equations that evolve over time. They are essential for scientific and engineering applications but remain challenging to emulate because of the unpredictable behavior of complex systems. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a fast and accurate Gaussian Process (GP)-based emulation method for complex dynamic simulators. By integrating linked GPs into the one-step-ahead emulation framework, the proposed algorithm provides exact and tractable computation of the posterior mean and variance, solving a problem previously considered computationally intractable and eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo approximations. This approach substantially reduces computation time while maintaining or improving predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the method naturally extends to systems with forcing inputs by incorporating them as additional variables within the GP framework. Numerical experiments on multiple dynamic systems demonstrate the efficiency and computational advantages of the proposed approach. An R package, dynemu, which implements the one-step-ahead emulation approach, is available on CRAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Time Marching Neural Operator FE Coupling: AI Accelerated Physics Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11383v4)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical solvers for PDEs often struggle to balance computational cost with accuracy, especially in multiscale and time-dependent systems. Neural operators offer a promising way to accelerate simulations, but their practical deployment is hindered by several challenges: they typically require large volumes of training data generated from high-fidelity solvers, tend to accumulate errors over time in dynamical settings, and often exhibit poor generalization in multiphysics scenarios. This work introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates physics-informed deep operator network with FEM through domain decomposition and leverages numerical analysis for time marching. Our innovation lies in efficient coupling FE and DeepONet subdomains via a Schwarz method, expecting to solve complex and nonlinear regions by a pretrained DeepONet, while the remainder is handled by conventional FE. To address the challenges of dynamic systems, we embed a time stepping scheme directly into the DeepONet, substantially reducing long-term error propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive subdomain evolution strategy enables the ML-resolved region to expand dynamically, capturing fine-scale features without remeshing. Our framework shows accelerated convergence rates (up to 20% improvement in convergence rates compared to conventional FE coupling approaches) while preserving solution fidelity with error margins consistently below 3%. Our study shows that our proposed hybrid solver: (1) reduces computational costs by eliminating fine mesh requirements, (2) mitigates error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, and (3) enables automatic adaptation to evolving physical phenomena. This work establishes a new paradigm for coupling state of the art physics based and machine learning solvers in a unified framework, offering a robust, reliable, and scalable pathway for high fidelity multiscale simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[When and how can inexact generative models still sample from the data manifold?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07581v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models. Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment. Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the manifold hypothesis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Nonparametric Reaction Coordinate Optimization with Histories: A Framework for Rare Event Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07326v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding, chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics. Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Irreversibility and Stochastic Systems: Part One](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08330v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the existence of different forward and backward mathematical representations depending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations have been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion models. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification of stochastic description for physical systems which are described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and conservative. In part one of this paper we first address this modeling problem for linear systems in a deterministic context. We show that forward-backward representations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional conservative system by {\em state-feedback} and can shift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another totally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time. In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two representations. Under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath can be shown to induce a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Adaptive Kalman Filtering via Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07037v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown. However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport. This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.</p></details> | 20 pages |

In our previous work, for the case $y = x_1$, we established a bound on the support of such a differential equation for the non-parametric case and shown that it can be turned into an algorithm via the evaluation-interpolation approach. The main contribution of the present paper is a generalization of the aforementioned result in two directions: to allow any polynomial function $y = f(\mathbf{x})$, not just a single coordinate, and to allow $\mathbf{g}$ and $f$ depend on unknown symbolic parameters. We conduct computation experiments to evaluate the accuracy of our new bound and show that the approach allows to perform elimination for some cases out of reach for the state of the art software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Smoothed Quantile Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01738v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian quantile regression based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) likelihood suffers from two fundamental limitations: the non-differentiability of the check loss precludes gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and the posterior mean provides biased quantile estimates. We propose Bayesian smoothed quantile regression (BSQR), which replaces the check loss with a kernel-smoothed version, creating a continuously differentiable likelihood. This smoothing has two crucial consequences: it enables efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, and it yields a consistent posterior distribution, thereby resolving the inferential bias of the standard approach. We further establish conditions for posterior propriety under various priors (including improper and hierarchical) and characterize how kernel choice affects posterior concentration and computational efficiency. Extensive simulations validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that BSQR achieves up to a 50% reduction in predictive check loss at extreme quantiles compared to ALD-based methods, while improving MCMC efficiency by 20-40% in effective sample size. An empirical application to financial risk measurement during the COVID-19 era illustrates BSQR's practical advantages in capturing dynamic systemic risk. The BSQR framework provides a theoretically-grounded and computationally-efficient solution to longstanding challenges in Bayesian quantile regression, with compact-support kernels like the uniform and triangular emerging as particularly effective choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms.

Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements (SP) that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a greedy algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic systems and observability theory, and yields SPs that are submodular and robust to hydraulic changes. Case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</p></details> |  |

These quasi-periodic solutions stay on some invariant tori governed by complex PDEs in hyper-time. Here, we propose a Fourier series expansion-based shooting method (FSE-Shooting) for the parallelized computation of quasi-periodic solution with $d$ base frequencies ($d \ge 2$). We represent the associated $d$-torus as a collection of trajectories initialized at a ($d-1$)-torus. We drive a set of ODEs that hold for any of these trajectories. We also derive a set of boundary conditions that couple the initial and terminal states of these trajectories and then formulate a set of nonlinear algebraic equations via the coupling conditions. We use Fourier series expansion to parameterize the ($d-1$)-torus and shooting method to iterate the Fourier coefficients associated with initial torus such that the coupling conditions are satisfied. In particular, the terminal points of these trajectories are parallelized computed via Newmark integration, where the time points and Fourier coefficients are transformed to each other by alternating Frequency-Time method. A straightforward phase condition is devised to track the quasi-periodic solutions with priori unknown base frequencies. Additionally, the by-product of the FSE-Shooting can be also directly used to compute the Lyapunov exponents to assess the stabilities of quasi-periodic solutions. The results of three finite element systems show the efficiency and versatility of FSE-Shooting in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, including a three-dimensional shell structure with $1872$ DOFs.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

The underlying dynamical system is an unknown linear controlled recursion, with the assumption that sufficiently rich input-output data from pre-operational experiments are available. The initial state is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, while the terminal state is required to match a specified Gaussian distribution. We reformulate the resulting optimal control problem as a difference-of-convex program and show that it can be efficiently and tractably solved using the DC algorithm.

The trajectory of the nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory. The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the Kolmogorov flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs via Double Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09222v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Gaussian processes have been used to model the vector field of continuous dynamical systems, referred to as GPODEs, which are characterized by a probabilistic ODE equation. Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential kernels has been common in GPODE research, limiting the model's ability to represent complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility and expressive power. We develop a data-driven variational learning algorithm that utilizes analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows, enabling simultaneous learning and inference of unknown continuous dynamics. Additionally, we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP ODEs to resolve the issue of strong mean-field assumptions in posterior inference. By applying normalizing flows in both these ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data recovery tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method effectively captures model uncertainty while improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time Splitting Based Optimization Method for Nonlinear MHE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23324v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving Horizon Estimation~(MHE) is essentially an optimization-based approach designed to estimate the states of dynamic systems within a moving time horizon. Traditional MHE solutions become computationally prohibitive due to the \textit{curse of dimensionality} arising from increasing problem complexity and growing length of time horizon. To address this issue, we propose novel computationally efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear MHE problems. Specifically, we first introduce a distributed reformulation utilizing a time-splitting technique. Leveraging this reformulation, we develop the Efficient Gauss-Newton Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) to achieve computational efficiency. Additionally, to accommodate limited computational capabilities inherent in some sub-problem solvers, we propose the Efficient Sensitivity Assisted ALADIN, which enables sub-problems to be solved inexactly without hindering computational efficiency. Furthermore, recognizing scenarios where sub-problem solvers possess no computational power, we propose a Distributed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that relies solely on first- and second-order information of local objective functions. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on differential drive robots case, a practical nonlinear MHE problem. Our results demonstrate that the three proposed algorithms achieve computational efficiency while preserving high accuracy, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of MHE.</p></details> |  |

At the core of our approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability. To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics, we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning. Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and tangential flows for graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Alternating Simulations for Policy Synthesis in Uncertain Stochastic Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05062v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A classical approach to formal policy synthesis in stochastic dynamical systems is to construct a finite-state abstraction, often represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). The correctness of these approaches hinges on a behavioural relation between the dynamical system and its abstraction, such as a probabilistic simulation relation. However, probabilistic simulation relations do not suffice when the system dynamics are, next to being stochastic, also subject to nondeterministic (i.e., set-valued) disturbances. In this work, we extend probabilistic simulation relations to systems with both stochastic and nondeterministic disturbances. Our relation, which is inspired by a notion of alternating simulation, generalises existing relations used for verification and policy synthesis used in several works. Intuitively, our relation allows reasoning probabilistically over stochastic uncertainty, while reasoning robustly (i.e., adversarially) over nondeterministic disturbances. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our relations for policy synthesis in a 4D-state Dubins vehicle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at CDC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uncovering the Influence Flow Model of Transistor Amplifiers, Its Reconstruction and Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04977v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multistage transistor amplifiers can be effectively modeled as network of dynamic systems where individual amplifier stages interact through couplings that are dynamic in nature. Using circuit analysis techniques, we show that a large class of transistor amplifiers can be modeled as Linear Dynamic Influence Model (LDIM), where the interactions between different amplifier stages are modeled as linear dynamic equations. LDIM modeling of transistor circuits leads to application of data-driven network reconstruction techniques to characterize stage interactions and identify faults and critical circuit parameters efficiently. Employing graphical modeling techniques and Wiener filtering, we demonstrate that the network structure can be reconstructed solely from voltage time-series measurements sampled at specified points in the circuit. The efficacy of these network reconstruction methods in multistage amplifiers is demonstrated through extensive simulations involving multiple amplifier circuits in Cadence, as well as experimental results on physical hardware. The ability to infer network structure directly from measurement data offers designers and users efficient tools to design, analyze, and debug amplifier circuits. To demonstrate the utility of network reconstruction in multistage amplifier circuits, a fault diagnosis method leveraging these techniques is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Case Studies of Generative Machine Learning Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04459v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are expensive to operate in the real world. The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors, simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely: minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder (VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04401v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03679v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

The approach combines phase-space reconstruction techniques with recurrence matrices and convolutional neural networks to identify precursors to extreme events. We evaluate the framework across three distinct testbed systems: a triad turbulent interaction model, a prototype stochastic anisotropic turbulent flow, and the Kolmogorov flow. This method offers three key advantages: (1) a threshold-free classification strategy that eliminates subjective parameter tuning, (2) efficient training using only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ recurrence matrices, and (3) ability to generalize to unseen systems. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance across all test systems: 96\% detection rate for the triad model with a mean lead time of 1.8 time units, 96\% for the anisotropic turbulent flow with a mean lead time of 6.1 time units, and 93\% for the Kolmogorov flow with a mean lead time of 22.7 units.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Glider Equation for Asymptotic Lenia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04167v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coded Kalman Filtering over MIMO Gaussian Channels with Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17196v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of remotely stabilizing a dynamical system. A sensor (encoder) co-located with the system communicates with a controller (decoder), whose goal is to stabilize the system, over a noisy communication channel with feedback. To accomplish this, the controller must estimate the system state with finite mean squared error (MSE). The vector-valued dynamical system state follows a Gauss-Markov law with additive control. The channel is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. For such a source, a linear encoder, and a MIMO AWGN channel, the minimal MSE decoder is a Kalman filter. The parameters of the Kalman filter and the linear encoder can be jointly optimized, under a power constraint at the channel input. We term the resulting encoder-decoder pair a coded Kalman filter. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the coded Kalman filter to achieve a finite MSE in the real-time estimation of the state. For sufficiency, we introduce a coding scheme where each unstable mode of the state is estimated using the channel outputs of a single sub-channel. We prove a coinciding necessity condition when either the source or channel is scalar and present a matrix-algebraic condition which implies the condition is necessary in general. Finally, we provide a new counter-example demonstrating that linear codes are generally sub-optimal for coding over MIMO channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review at IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Control Closure Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03947v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the notion of control closure certificates to synthesize controllers for discrete-time control systems against $\omega$-regular specifications. Typical functional approaches to synthesize controllers against $\omega$-regular specifications rely on combining inductive invariants (for example, via barrier certificates) with proofs of well-foundedness (for example, via ranking functions). Transition invariants, provide an alternative where instead of standard well-foundedness arguments one may instead search for disjunctive well-foundedness arguments that together ensure a well-foundedness argument. Closure certificates, functional analogs of transition invariants, provide an effective, automated approach to verify discrete-time dynamical systems against linear temporal logic and $\omega$-regular specifications. We build on this notion to synthesize controllers to ensure the satisfaction of $\omega$-regular specifications. To do so, we first illustrate how one may construct control closure certificates to visit a region infinitely often (or only finitely often) via disjunctive well-founded arguments. We then combine these arguments to provide an argument for parity specifications. Thus, finding an appropriate control closure certificate over the product of the system and a parity automaton specifying a desired $\omega$-regular specification ensures that there exists a controller $\kappa$ to enforce the $\omega$-regular specification. We propose a sum-of-squares optimization approach to synthesize such certificates and demonstrate their efficacy in designing controllers over some case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures, 6 Tables.

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links, and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels. However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER, we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025. 11 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Safety-Aware Imitation Learning via MPC-Guided Disturbance Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03129v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating improvements in both safety and task performance.

| **[A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01', `10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8469 etc.). Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression, which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information processing.</p></details> | 4 figures, 3 tables |

While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically analyzes a large number of possible galloping gaits by categorizing them based on the number of flight phases per stride and the phase relationships between the front and rear legs, following Hildebrand's framework for asymmetrical gaits. Using the A1 quadrupedal robot from Unitree, we model galloping dynamics as a hybrid dynamical system and employ trajectory optimization (TO) to minimize the cost of transport (CoT) across a range of speeds. Our results reveal that rotary and transverse gallop footfall sequences exhibit no fundamental energetic difference, despite variations in body yaw and roll motion. However, the number of flight phases significantly impacts energy efficiency: galloping with no flight phases is optimal at lower speeds, whereas galloping with two flight phases minimizes energy consumption at higher speeds. We validate these findings using a quadratic programming (QP)-based controller, developed in our previous work, in Gazebo simulations. These insights advance the understanding of quadrupedal locomotion energetics and may inform future legged robot designs for adaptive, energy-efficient gait transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for IROS 2025</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and dynamical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convex Computations for Controlled Safety Invariant Sets of Black-box Discrete-time Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01638v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying controlled safety invariant sets (CSISs) is essential in safety-critical applications. This paper tackles the problem of identifying CSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the model is unknown and only limited simulation data is accessible. Traditionally, a CSIS is defined as a subset of a safe set, encompassing initial states for which a control input exists that keeps the system within the set at the next time step-this is referred to as the one-step invariance property. However, the requirement for one-step invariance can be equivalently translated into a stricter condition of ``always-invariance'', meaning that there exist control inputs capable of keeping the system within this set indefinitely. Such a condition may prove overly stringent or impractical for black-box systems, where predictions can become unreliable beyond a single time step or a limited number of finite time steps. To overcome the challenges posed by black-box systems, we reformulate the one-step invariance property in a ``Probably Approximately Correct'' (PAC) sense. This approach allows us to assess the probability that a control input exists to keep the system within the CSIS at the next time step, with a predefined level of confidence. If the system successfully remains within the set at the next time step, we can then reapply the invariance evaluation to the new state, thereby facilitating a recursive assurance of invariance. Our method employs barrier functions and scenario optimization, resulting in a linear programming method to estimate PAC CSISs. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on several examples.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, a significant research gap exists in the field of input design for nonlinear dynamic system identification. In particular, existing methods largely overlook the minimization of the generalization error, i.e., model inaccuracies in regions not covered by the estimation dataset. This work addresses this gap by proposing an input design method that embeds a novel optimality criterion within a receding horizon control (RHC)-based optimization framework. The distance-based optimality criterion induces a space-filling design within a user-defined region of interest in a surrogate model's input space, requiring only minimal prior knowledge. Additionally, the method is applicable both online, where model parameters are continuously updated based on process observations, and offline, where a fixed model is employed. The space-filling performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on an artificial example and compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior efficiency in exploring process operating regions.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover, the proposed critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due to its robustness to extreme initial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, accepted at Artificial Life conference 2025</p></details> |

This category contains, among its isomorphisms, mod-zero isomorphisms of probability spaces. It also gives an isomorphism between the space of values of a random variable and the sigma-algebra that it generates on the outcome space, reflecting the standard mathematical practice of using the two interchangeably, for example when taking conditional expectations. We show that a number of constructions and results from classical probability theory, mostly involving notions of equilibrium, can be expressed and proven in terms of this category. In particular: - Given a stochastic dynamical system acting on a standard Borel space, we show that the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra can be obtained as a limit and as a colimit; - In the setting above, the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra gives rise, up to isomorphism of our category, to a standard Borel space; - As a corollary, we give a categorical version of the ergodic decomposition theorem for stochastic actions; - As an example, we show how de Finetti's theorem and the Hewitt-Savage and Kolmogorov zero-one laws fit in this limit-colimit picture. This work uses the tools of categorical probability, in particular Markov categories, as well as the theory of dagger categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, part of this work appears in the dissertation of the first author submitted towards the degree of MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[HiPPO-Prophecy: State-Space Models can Provably Learn Dynamical Systems in Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09375v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the in-context learning capabilities of State Space Models (SSMs) and presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical explanation of a possible underlying mechanism. We introduce a novel weight construction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamical system after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically. This work should be an initial step toward understanding how sequence models based on SSMs learn in context.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024, Next Generation Sequence Modeling Architectures Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Confabulation dynamics in a reservoir computer: Filling in the gaps with untrained attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04792v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01519v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness. Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is $O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural ODEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling high and low extremes with a novel dynamic spatio-temporal model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01481v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme environmental events such as severe storms, drought, heat waves, flash floods, and abrupt species collapse have become more prevalent in the earth-atmosphere dynamic system in recent years. In order to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and enhance informed decision-making, a flexible model capable of accommodating extremes is necessary. Existing dynamic spatio-temporal statistical models exhibit limitations in capturing extremes when assuming Gaussian error distributions, whereas the current models for spatial extremes mostly assume temporal independence and are focused on joint upper tails at two or more locations. Here, we introduce a new class of dynamic spatio-temporal models that capture both high and low extremes using a mixture of heavy- and light-tailed distributions with varying tail indices. Our framework flexibly identifies extremal dependence and independence in both space and time with uncertainty quantification and supports missing data prediction, as in other dynamic spatio-temporal models. We demonstrate its effectiveness using a large reanalysis dataset of hourly particulate matter in the Central United States.</p></details> |  |
