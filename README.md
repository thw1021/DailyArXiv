| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALM-PDE: Continuous and Adaptive Convolutions for Latent Space Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12944v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025, San Diego, California, USA</p></details> |
| **[The inverse initial data problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations via Legendre time reduction method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16810v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the inverse initial data problem for the compressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial velocity field from lateral boundary observations. This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding diffusion models to reconstruct flow fields from sparse data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19971v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/tum-pbs/sparse-reconstruction</p></details> |
| **[PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Residual-guided AI-CFD hybrid method enables stable and scalable simulations: from 2D benchmarks to 3D applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21804v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning (ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable, accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in real-world engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16992v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code at https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT</p></details> |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unconditionally Stable, Variable Step DLN Methods for the Allen-Cahn Active Fluid Model: A Divergence-free Preserving Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16860v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the divergence-free mixed finite element method (FEM) for nonlinear fourth-order Allen-Cahn phase field coupled active fluid equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$, the original fourth-order problem is converted into a system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-comforming finite element spaces. To further refine the formulation, an additional auxiliary variable $\xi$, analogous to the pressure, is introduced, resulting in a mixed finite element scheme that preserves the divergence-free condition in $which = \Delta u$ inherited from the model. A fully discrete scheme is then established by combining the spatial approximation by the divergence-free mixed finite element method with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme is rigorously derived under suitable regularity assumptions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on the minimum dissipation criterion is carried out to enhance computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrivAerStar: An Industrial-Grade CFD Dataset for Vehicle Aerodynamic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16857v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16399v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AB-UPT for Automotive and Aerospace Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15808v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) shows strong capabilities to replicate automotive computational fluid dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both datasets were generated with the Luminary Cloud platform containing automotives (SHIFT-SUV) and aircrafts (SHIFT-Wing). We start by detailing the data generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model. AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near perfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a simple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a day on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNO: Multiscale Neural Operator for Computational Fluid Dynamics with 3D Point Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16071v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Clifford-Steerable CNNs with Complete Kernel Basis for PDE Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our method consistently outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Property Testing for Ocean Models. Can We Specify It? (Invited Talk)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13692v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I take inspiration from the property-testing literature, particularly the work of Prof. John Hughes, and explore how such ideas might be applied to numerical models of the ocean. Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address the oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a number of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These examples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying property tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and useful, remains to be seen.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings VSS 2025, arXiv:2510.12314</p></details> |
| **[Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Prior for First Order Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20278v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design optimization aims to infer system parameters from observed solutions, posing critical challenges across domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, structural engineering, materials science, and fluid dynamics. The lack of explicit mathematical representations in many systems complicates this process and makes the first order optimization impossible. Mainstream approaches, including generative AI and Bayesian optimization, address these challenges but have limitations. Generative AI is computationally expensive, while Bayesian optimization, relying on surrogate models, suffers from scalability, sensitivity to priors, and noise issues, often leading to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces Deep Physics Prior (DPP), a novel method enabling first-order gradient-based inverse optimization with surrogate machine learning models. By leveraging pretrained auxiliary Neural Operators, DPP enforces prior distribution constraints to ensure robust and meaningful solutions. This approach is particularly effective when prior data and observation distributions are unknown.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Constrained Sensing and Reliable State Estimation with Shallow Recurrent Decoders on a TRIGA Mark II Reactor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12368v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel data-driven methodology able to provide accurate state estimation in engineering systems, such as nuclear reactors. This deep learning architecture is a robust technique designed to map the temporal trajectories of a few sparse measures to the full state space, including unobservable fields, which is agnostic to sensor positions and able to handle noisy data through an ensemble strategy, leveraging the short training times and without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Following its application to a novel reactor concept, this work investigates the performance of Shallow Recurrent Decoders when applied to a real system. The underlying model is represented by a fluid dynamics model of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor; the architecture will use both synthetic temperature data coming from the numerical model and leveraging experimental temperature data recorded during a previous campaign. The objective of this work is, therefore, two-fold: 1) assessing if the architecture can reconstruct the full state of the system (temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulence quantities) given sparse data located in specific, low-dynamics channels and 2) assessing the correction capabilities of the architecture (that is, given a discrepancy between model and data, assessing if sparse measurements can provide some correction to the architecture output). As will be shown, the accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field, using both synthetic and experimental data, in real-time makes this approach suitable for interpretable monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</p></details> | 40 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Blade: A Derivative-free Bayesian Inversion Method using Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10968v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We starting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid bilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and thermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers. The most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system, describing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with phase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using trace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability in representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine physical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The computational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against experimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors, demonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics is essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in epi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate external forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic lipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.</p></details> |  |

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems.

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers high-fidelity predictions, its computational cost limits its use in iterative design. Equivalent Mechanical Models (EMMs) provide a faster alternative, though their predictive performance, especially in closed-loop scenarios, remains largely unexplored. This work presents a comparative analysis of a spacecraft under feedback control, using both CFD and a reduced-order sloshing model. Results show good agreement, validating the simplified model for the manoeuvrer considered. This validation enables efficient sensitivity and stability studies, offering a practical tool for early-stage spacecraft design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update after NIPS suggestions</p></details> |

The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Performance of a high-order MPI-Kokkos accelerated fluid solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05254v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work discusses the performance of a modern numerical scheme for fluid dynamical problems on modern high-performance computing architectures. Our code implements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an order of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta methods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations as well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In order to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units and accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in conjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on various GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code. Eighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing time than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller impact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to generally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs. The many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed up to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size simulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over CPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\approx 3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical simulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large grid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency that the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use it efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need longer computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the energy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 16 figures. submitted to Computer Physics Communications</p></details> |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03699v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.</p></details> |  |

We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition. Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</p></details> |  |

This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing.

The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative which reformulates the problem on a larger, simple domain where the complex geometry is represented by a smooth phase-field function. This paper introduces and analyses several new DDM methods for solving problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We derive two new methods from the mixed formulation of the governing equations. This approach transforms the essential Dirichlet conditions into natural boundary conditions. Additionally, we develop coercive formulations based on Nitsche's method, and provide proofs of coercivity for all new and key existing approximations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved accuracy of the new methods, and reveal the balance between $L^2$ and $H^1$ errors. The practical effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a benchmark fluid dynamics problems.</p></details> |  |

These methods can fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based scientific predictions.

| **[Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24573v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.</p></details> |  |

Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The first-order optimality condition for a state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space reduction.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |
| **[Likelihood-informed Model Reduction for Bayesian Inference of Static Structural Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07950v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use data to update a prior probability distribution on uncertain parameter values to a posterior distribution. Such problems arise in many structural engineering applications, but computational solution of Bayesian inverse problems is often expensive because standard solution approaches require many evaluations of the forward model mapping the parameter value to predicted observations. In many settings, this forward model is expensive because it requires the solution of a high-dimensional discretization of a partial differential equation. However, Bayesian inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure because the available data are primarily informative (relative to the prior) in a low-dimensional subspace, sometimes called the likelihood-informed subspace (LIS). This paper proposes a new projection-based model reduction method for static linear systems that exploits this low-dimensional structure in the setting where the unknown parameter is the right-hand-side forcing. The proposed method projects the governing partial differential equation onto the likelihood-informed subspace, yielding a computationally efficient reduced model that can be used to accelerate the solution of the inverse problem. Numerical experiments on two structural engineering model problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully exploit the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the problem, obtaining relative errors of O(10^{-10}) in the inverse problem solution with a 10x-100x lower-dimensional model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |
| **[SubApSnap: Solving parameter-dependent linear systems with a snapshot and subsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04825v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing number of problems in computational mathematics can be reduced to the solution of many linear systems that are related, often depending smoothly or slowly on a parameter $p$, that is, $A(p)x(p)=b(p)$. We introduce an efficient algorithm for solving such parameter-dependent linear systems for many values of $p$. The algorithm, which we call SubApSnap (for \emph{Sub}sampled $A(p)$ times \emph{Snap}shot), is based on combining ideas from model order reduction and randomised linear algebra: namely, taking a snapshot matrix, and solving the resulting tall-skinny least-squares problems using a subsampling-based dimension-reduction approach. We show that SubApSnap is a strict generalisation of the popular DEIM algorithm in nonlinear model order reduction. SubApSnap is a sublinear-time algorithm, and once the snapshot and subsampling are determined, it solves $A(p_*)x(p_*)=b(p_*)$ for a new value of $p_*$ at a dramatically improved speed: it does not even need to read the whole matrix $A(p_*)$ to solve the linear system for a new value of $p_*$. We prove under natural assumptions that, given a good subsampling and snapshot, SubApSnap yields solutions with small residual for all parameter values of interest. We illustrate the efficiency and performance of the algorithm with problems arising in PDEs, model reduction, and kernel ridge regression, where SubApSnap achieves speedups of many orders of magnitude over a standard solution; for example over $20,000\times$ for a $10^7\times 10^7$ problem, while providing good accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |

The Oja flow is a matrix differential equation on the Stiefel manifold designed to extract a dominant subspace. While its analysis has traditionally been restricted to symmetric positive-definite matrices, where it acts as a gradient flow, recent applications have extended its use to general matrices. In this non-symmetric case, the flow extracts the invariant subspace corresponding to the eigenvalues with the largest real parts. However, prior convergence results have been purely local, leaving the global behavior as an open problem. This paper fills this gap by providing a comprehensive global convergence analysis, establishing that the flow converges exponentially for almost all initial conditions. We also propose a modification to the algorithm that enhances its numerical stability. As an application of this theory, we develop novel methods for the model reduction of linear dynamical systems and the synthesis of low-rank stabilizing controllers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

The scheme is related to the Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for model reduction, but uses an adaptive algorithm for selection of frequency points for interrogating the system response, as would be required in identification versus model reduction. The scheme is particularly suited for systems in which any one sinusoidal response run is long or expensive, and thus there is an incentive to reduce the total number of such runs. Two key features of our algorithm are the use of transient data in sinusoidal runs to both optimize the barycentric weights, and automated next-frequency selection on an adaptive grid. Both are done with error criteria that are proxies for a system's $H^2$ and $H^\infty$ norms respectively. Furthermore, the optimization problem we formulate is convex, and can optionally guarantee stability of the identified system. Computational results on a high-order, lightly damped structural system highlights the efficacy of this scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures Submitted to IEEE American Control Conference 2026</p></details> |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |

Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20615v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite Sample Analysis of Open-loop Subspace Identification Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16639v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subspace identification methods (SIMs) are known for their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical properties. However, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem. Following a three-step procedure generally used in SIMs, this work presents a finite sample analysis for open-loop SIMs. In Step 1 we begin with a parsimonious SIM. Leveraging a recent analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain a union error bound for a Hankel-like matrix constructed from a bank of ARX models. Step 2 involves model reduction via weighted singular value decomposition (SVD), where we use robustness results for SVD to obtain error bounds on extended controllability and observability matrices, respectively. The final Step 3 focuses on deriving error bounds for system matrices, where two different realization algorithms, the MOESP type and the CVA type, are studied. Our results not only agree with classical asymptotic results, but also show how much data is needed to guarantee a desired error bound with high probability. The proposed method generalizes related finite sample analyses and applies broadly to many variants of SIMs.</p></details> |  |

In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |

With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</p></details> |  |

Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Possible Principles for Aligned Structure Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00258v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models for fluid-porous systems: derivation, analysis and validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16577v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow interaction between a plain-fluid region in contact with a porous layer attracted significant attention from modelling and analysis sides due to numerous applications in biology, environment and industry. In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, Published in Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2025, DOI:/10.1016/j.amc.2025.129687</p></details> |
| **[Power-Series Approach to Moment-Matching-Based Model Reduction of MIMO Polynomial Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13595v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The model reduction problem for high-order multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) polynomial nonlinear systems based on moment matching is addressed. The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |

The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition, respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction, leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large and complex quantum systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for High-Dimensional Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09084v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is widely used for model reduction, its standard form does not take into account any parametric model structure. Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these either require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have limited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead assigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever the model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a posteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these weights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to compute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted POD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced basis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and snapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how these approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without the need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with and without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell thickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent partial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this problem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using weighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold interpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer high-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient data-driven regression for reduced-order modeling of spatial pattern formation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06833v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an efficient data-driven regression approach for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) of reaction-diffusion systems exhibiting pattern formation. The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |

While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Tensor-based reduction of linear parameter-varying state-space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23591v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed to assess scalability.</p></details> |  |

For this, we use a Petrov-Galerkin ansatz together with appropriate projections. Numerical results for a nonlinear circuit model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nonlinear Causal Reductions to Explain Reinforcement Learning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14901v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we generate tools and concepts for minimizing a class of energy functionals in an abstract Hilbert space setting covering a wide scope of applications such as PDEs-based inverse problems and supervised learning. The approach hinges on a Hilbert space metric in the full diffeomorphism mapping space, which could be viewed as a generalized Wasserstein-2 metric. We then study a projection gradient descent method within deep neural network parameterized sets. More importantly, we develop an adaptation and expanding strategy to step-by-step enlarge the deep neural network structures. In particular, the expansion mechanism aims to enhance the alignment of the neural manifold induced natural gradient direction as well as possible with the ideal Hilbert space gradient descent direction leveraging the fact that we can evaluate projections of the Hilbert space gradient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for several simple model problems for energies arising in the context of supervised learning, model reduction, or inverse problems. In particular, we highlight the importance of assembling the neural flow matrix based on the inner product for the ambient Hilbert space. The actual algorithms are the simplest specifications of a broader spectrum based on a correspondingly wider discussion, postponing a detailed analysis to forthcoming work.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |
| **[Kernel-based Greedy Approximation of Parametric Elliptic Boundary Value Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06731v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We recently introduced a scale of kernel-based greedy schemes for approximating the solutions of elliptic boundary value problems. The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory. The resulting representation allows one to place error bounds on the $H_{\infty}$ norm on a reduced-order representation of the system computed using finite-dimensional nonlinear Controllability and Observability Gramians.</p></details> |  |
| **[An ensemble Kalman approach to randomized maximum likelihood estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03207v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes ensemble Kalman randomized maximum likelihood estimation, a new derivative-free method for performing randomized maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method that can be used to generate approximate samples from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems. The new method has connections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so that each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed optimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members converge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and, furthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior when applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method requires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data, be evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively expensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method tractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method tailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem. Theoretical results show near-optimality of this model reduction approach via convergence to an optimal approximation of the posterior covariance as a low-rank update to the prior covariance. Numerical experiments verify theoretical results and illustrate computational acceleration through model reduction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |
| **[Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum volume coordinates for Grassmann interpolation: Lagrange, Hermite, and errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01574v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to Riemannian interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. Instead of relying on the Riemannian normal coordinates, i.e. the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps, we approach the interpolation problem with an alternative set of local coordinates and corresponding parameterizations. A special property of these coordinates is that their calculation does not require any matrix decompositions. This is a numerical advantage over Riemann normal coordinates and many other retractions on the Grassmann manifold, especially when derivative data are to be treated. To estimate the interpolation error, we examine the conditioning of these mappings and state explicit bounds. It turns out that the parameterizations are well-conditioned, but the coordinate mappings are generally not. As a remedy, we introduce maximum-volume coordinates that are based on a search for subblocks of column-orthogonal matrices of large absolute determinant. We show that the order of magnitude of the asymptotic interpolation error on $\Gr(n,p)$ is the same as in the Euclidean space. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first is an academic one, where we interpolate a parametric orthogonal projector $QQ^T$, where the $Q$--factor stems from a parametric compact QR--decomposition. The second experiment is in the context of parametric model reduction of dynamical systems, where we interpolate reduced subspaces that are obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</p></details> |  |

We propose a complete framework comprising offline-online stages for the development of reduced order models using the cross-correlation based snapshots registration.

We show there is freedom in the interpolation point selection method, leading to multiple algorithms that have trade-offs between computational complexity and approximation performance. We prove that a weighted \(H_2\) norm of a representative error system is monotonically decreasing as interpolation points are added.

Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 4 figures, 2 tables; 25 pages supplementary material, 8 figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, cdc2025</p></details> |

A key feature of the ML-VMS method is the use of the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) as the approximation basis. The framework employs a coarse mesh throughout the domain, with localized fine meshes placed only in subdomains of high interest, such as those surrounding a source. Solutions at different resolutions are robustly coupled through the variational weak form and interface conditions. Compared to existing multilevel methods, ML-VMS (1) can couple an arbitrary number of mesh levels across different scales using variational multiscale framework; (2) allows approximating functions with arbitrary orders with linear finite element mesh due to the C-HiDeNN basis; (3) is supported by a rigorous theoretical error analysis; (4) features several tunable hyperparameters (e.g., order $p$, patch size $s$) with a systematic guide for their selection. We first show the theoretical error estimates of ML-VMS. Then through numerical examples, we demonstrate that ML-VMS with the C-HiDeNN takes less computational time than the FEM basis given comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a space-time reduced-order model (ROM) based on C-HiDeNN-Tensor Decomposition (TD) into the ML-VMS framework. For a large-scale single-track laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) transient heat transfer problem that is equivalent to a full-order finite element model with $10^{10}$ spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), our 3-level ML-VMS C-HiDeNN-TD achieves an approximately 5,000x speedup on a single CPU over a single-level linear FEM-TD ROM.</p></details> |  |

Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across various PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation that is readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers, available at https://phi-rom.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preconditioning and Reduced-Order Modeling of Navier-Stokes Equations in Complex Porous Microstructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22077v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations within the complex microstructure of a porous material. Discretizing the equations on a fine grid using a staggered (e.g., marker-and-cell, mixed FEM) scheme results in a nonlinear residual. Adopting the Newton method, a linear system must be solved at each iteration, which is large, ill-conditioned, and has a saddle-point structure. This demands an iterative (e.g., Krylov) solver, that requires preconditioning to ensure rapid convergence. We propose two monolithic \textit{algebraic} preconditioners, $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{NS}}$, that are generalizations of previously proposed forms by the authors for the Stokes equations ($a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{S}}$). The former is based on the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and the latter on the pore network model (PNM), both successful approximate solvers. We also formulate faster-converging geometric preconditioners $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ and $g\mathrm{PNM}$, which impose $\partial_n\boldsymbol{u}\!=\!0$ (zero normal-gradient of velocity) exactly at subdomain interfaces. Finally, we propose an accurate coarse-scale solver for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations based on $g\mathrm{PLMM}$, capable of computing approximate solutions orders of magnitude faster. We benchmark our preconditioners against state-of-the-art block preconditioners and show $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ is the best-performing one, followed closely by $a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ for steady-state flow and $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ for transient flow. All preconditioners can be built and applied on parallel machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p></details> |  |

This demand response strategy helps distribution grid to flexibly ramp-up or ramp-down local load demand so that it can optimally match the bulk power system generation profile. However, achieving this capability requires house thermal models that are both computationally efficient and robust to operating conditions. In this work, parameters of the Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network thermal model for houses are estimated using three optimization algorithms: Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), Batch Estimation (BE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The resulting models are evaluated through a Forward-Simulation across four different seasons and three setpoints. The results illustrate a principled way of selecting reduced order models and estimation methods with respect to the robustness offered to seasonal and setpoint variations in training-testing datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a version of our paper accepted at the 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

We utilize this framework to parameterize the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile phase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation analytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate synthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary conditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of advection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of required forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a reduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the advection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the synthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by Projected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against several alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global random optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using nearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to 295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers accurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers to link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics, and measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the analysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional forward simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Water Resources Research</p></details> |
| **[Application of Reduced-Order Models for Temporal Multiscale Representations in the Prediction of Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18925v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regul...</summary><p>Regular research article, 28 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields. We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving performance estimation of a PCM-integrated solar chimney through reduced-order based data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16469v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM) integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and 203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing Low-Dimensional Structure in 2D Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities via Parametric Reduced-Order Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16197v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning-Based Ultrasonic Weld Characterization Using Hierarchical Wave Modeling and Diffusion-Driven Distribution Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13023v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings (resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Partial Differential Equations on Parameter-Dependent Domains Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17171v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or the solution of the equations over multiple parameters. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, reduced order models (ROMs) are built using a set of precomputed solutions (snapshots) corresponding to different parameter values. Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM, offering improved flexibility and performance. In many cases, the domain on which the PDE is defined also varies. Capturing this variation is important for building accurate ROMs but is often difficult, especially when the domain has a complex structure or changes topology. In this paper, we propose a Deep-ROM framework that can automatically extract useful domain parametrization and incorporate it into the model. Unlike traditional domain parameterization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. It can also learn from domain data even when no mesh is available. Using deep autoencoders, our approach reduces the dimensionality of both the PDE solution and the domain representation, making it possible to approximate solutions efficiently across a wide range of domain shapes and parameter values. We demonstrate that our approach produces parametrizations that yield solution accuracy comparable to models using exact parameters. Importantly, our model remains stable under moderate geometric variations in the domain, such as boundary deformations and noise - scenarios where traditional ROMs often require remeshing or manual adjustment.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Statistical reduced order modelling for the parametric Helmholtz equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04438v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, associated code available at https://github.com/herluc/statROM.

| **[Fast Subspace Fluid Simulation with a Temporally-Aware Basis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05339v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, memory-efficient, and user-controllable subspace simulation. We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.</p></details> |  |

In the context of damage detection, parametric reduced order models (ROMs) are well suited for fast computations by establishing an efficient offline/online split of the simulation process. The problems of interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and efficient reduction with low online cost. We demonstrate the applicability of the ROM approach with benchmark tests on linear elastic problems discretized with splines and the extended isogeometric method (XIGA) for crack modelling. The results we obtain show the accuracy and real-time efficiency of the constructed reduced order models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference taking place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in May 2026</p></details> |

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport. GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, First authors contributed equally</p></details> |

This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p></details> |  |

Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the topology optimization of structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures.

This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics. To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation, demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code https://github.com/dcherenson/adaptive-control-underactuated</p></details> |

Specifically, we investigate how machine learning can be employed to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model, both at the Full Order Model (FOM) and Reduced Order Model (ROM) levels. We explore a novel integration of these two areas. We generate the FOM snapshots, essential for ROM construction, using a data-driven RANS model: the $\nu_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This is the first time that these machine learning procedure generalizes a large parametric variation, and we propose tailored training strategies to increase the accuracy of the FOM model. At the ROM level, we compare the results obtained by standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition in an intrusive Galerkin setting (PODG) and POD Neural Network approach (PODNN). The numerical validation is based on a classic turbulent flow benchmark: the flow in a square duct. Our investigation reveals that the PODG method, proves unstable and inaccurate for turbulent flow prediction, while PODNN demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each, derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

| **[From Shadow to Light: Toward Safe and Efficient Policy Learning Across MPC, DeePC, RL, and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04076v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances, data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique, such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft robots, and vehicle motion control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential decoder training for improved latent space dynamics identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03535v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGRDN-Data learned sparsification of graph reaction-diffusion networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11943v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph sparsification is an area of interest in computer science and applied mathematics. Sparsification of a graph, in general, aims to reduce the number of edges in the network while preserving specific properties of the graph, like cuts and subgraph counts. Computing the sparsest cuts of a graph is known to be NP-hard, and sparsification routines exist for generating linear-sized sparsifiers in almost quadratic running time $O(n^{2 + \epsilon})$. Consequently, obtaining a sparsifier can be a computationally demanding task, and the complexity varies based on the level of sparsity required. We propose SGRDN to extend sparsification to complex reaction-diffusion systems. This approach seeks to sparsify the graph such that the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics are strictly preserved on the resulting structure. By selectively considering a subset of trajectories, we frame the network sparsification issue as a data assimilation problem within a Reduced Order Model (ROM) space, imposing constraints to conserve the eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix ($L = D - A$), the difference between the degree matrix ($D$) and the adjacency matrix ($A$) despite perturbations. We derive computationally efficient eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations for perturbed Laplacian matrices and integrate these as spectral preservation constraints in the optimization problem. To further validate the method's broad applicability, we conducted an additional experiment on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs), where SGRDN successfully achieved parameter sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[oRANS: Online optimisation of RANS machine learning models with embedded DNS data generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02982v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains. Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes without requiring large precomputed training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |

The PISR framework combines symbolic regression with physics-based constraints, boundary conditions, and available simulation data to guide the search for solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by rediscovering approximate solutions consistent with previously published numerical results, showcasing the potential of PISR for reducing simulation costs of reduced-order models in plasma physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 7 sections, 53 referenced works</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for deployment in operational systems or for training with computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators -- such as reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or generative world models -- can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a control variate formed from a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. We show that under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence of REINFORCE to locally optimal policies in the target environment, and achieves faster finite-sample convergence rates compared to training with high-fidelity data alone. Empirically, we evaluate the MFPG algorithm across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. With mild-moderate dynamics gaps, MFPG reliably improves the median performance over a high-fidelity-only baseline, matching the performance of leading multi-fidelity baselines despite its simplicity and minimal tuning overhead. Under large dynamics gaps, MFPG demonstrates the strongest robustness among the evaluated multi-fidelity approaches. An additional experiment shows that MFPG can remain effective even under low-fidelity reward misspecification. Thus, MFPG not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Control via Recurrent Tracking Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01147v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs), which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control $\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs' effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.</p></details> | 7 Pages, 2 Figures |
| **[Deep Learning for Subspace Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23249v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive CUR Algorithm and its Application to Reduced-Order Modeling of Random PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21480v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Certain classes of CUR algorithms, also referred to as cross or pseudoskeleton algorithms, are widely used for low-rank matrix approximation when direct access to all matrix entries is costly. Their key advantage lies in constructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of the target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for reduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where nonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or even full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$. CUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the rank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of accuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability. In this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the intersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error analysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We also present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling entries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several nonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reservoir computing based predictive reduced order model for steel grade intermixing in an industrial continuous casting tundish](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26293v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous casting is a widely adopted process in the steel industry, where maintaining high steel quality is paramount. Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology as a fast, reliable tool for real-time process monitoring and optimization in industrial continuous casting operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpolated Adaptive Linear Reduced Order Modeling for Deformation Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25392v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear reduced-order modeling (ROM) is widely used for efficient simulation of deformation dynamics, but its accuracy is often limited by the fixed linearization of the reduced mapping. We propose a new adaptive strategy for linear ROM that allows the reduced mapping to vary dynamically in response to the evolving deformation state, significantly improving accuracy over traditional linear approaches. To further handle large deformations, we introduce a historical displacement basis combined with Grassmann interpolation, enabling the system to recover robustly even in challenging scenarios. We evaluate our method through quantitative online-error analysis and qualitative comparisons with principal component analysis (PCA)-based linear ROM simulations, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains while preserving comparable computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional approaches, we start by applying said transform to the evolution problem, yielding a time-independent boundary value problem that depends on the complex Laplace parameter. First, in an offline stage, we appropriately sample the Laplace parameter and solve the collection of problems using the finite element method. Next, we apply a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to this collection of solutions in order to obtain a reduced basis that is of dimension much smaller than that of the original solution space. This reduced basis, in turn, is then used to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. A key insight to justify the formulation of the method resorts to Hardy spaces of analytic functions. By applying the widely-known Paley-Wiener theorem we can then define an isometry between the solution of the time-dependent problem and its Laplace transform. As a consequence of this result, one may conclude that computing a POD with samples taken in the Laplace domain produces an exponentially accurate reduced basis for the time-dependent problem. Numerical experiments characterizing the performance of the method, in terms of accuracy and speed-up, are included for a variety of relevant time-evolution equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating High-Fidelity Fixed Point Schemes with On-the-fly Reduced Order Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22846v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A general method for accelerating fixed point schemes for problems related to partial differential equations is presented in this article. The speedup is obtained by training a reduced-order model on-the-fly, removing the need to do an offline training phase and any dependence to a precomputed reduced basis (e.g. a fixed geometry or mesh). The surrogate model can adapt itself along the iterations because of an error criterion based on error propagation, ensuring the high fidelity of the converged result. Convergence results are given for a general class of fixed point problems with complex dependence structures between multiple auxiliary linear systems. The proposed algorithm is applied to the solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations. The speedups obtained are significant, and the output of the method can be considered high-fidelity when compared to the reference solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenUQ: Predictive Uncertainty Estimates via Generative Hyper-Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21605v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</p></details> |  |

A human-inspired paradigm was designed for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |

By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Computational Science Graduate Project</p></details> |

This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |

Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven balanced truncation for linear systems with quadratic outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12393v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the framework for a non-intrusive, quadrature-based method for approximate balanced truncation (QuadBT) of linear systems with quadratic outputs, thus extending the applicability of QuadBT, which was originally designed for data-driven balanced truncation of standard linear systems with linear outputs only. The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system's infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. We validate the proposed framework on a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Chebyshev--Ritz Spectral Framework for Nonlinear Vibration of CNT-Reinforced Composite Beams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11946v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a spectral Ritz formulation for the nonlinear free vibration analysis of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) beams. Boundary-adapted Chebyshev basis functions are constructed to exactly satisfy clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The governing equations incorporate von~K\'{a}rm\'{a}n geometric nonlinearity, while the effective material properties for both uniform and functionally graded (FG) CNT distributions are evaluated using a modified rule of mixtures. Discretization via the Chebyshev-Ritz approach produces a reduced-order model exhibiting exponential convergence; for basis sizes $N \geq 12$, the fundamental frequency error remains below $0.1\%$ relative to published benchmarks. Computational results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains, with the spectral approach requiring significantly less time than high-fidelity finite element discretizations of comparable accuracy. Parametric studies reveal that the fundamental frequency increases with CNT volume fraction and is sensitive to the interfacial load-transfer efficiency parameter $\eta_E$. Selected FG patterns are shown to enhance stiffness relative to uniformly distributed CNTs. Validation against established numerical benchmarks yields relative differences of only a few percent. The current limitation of the method is its reliance on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumption, which neglects transverse shear deformation and damping; addressing these effects is proposed for future work. All numerical data and scripts are provided as supplementary material to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language model-empowered next-generation computer-aided engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11447v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Deep Global Model Reduction Learning in Porous Media Flow Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09335v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we combine deep learning concepts and some proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model reduction methods for predicting flow in heterogeneous porous media. Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

This paper presents a computationally efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%, and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains, including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2025</p></details> |
| **[Taming High-Dimensional Dynamics: Learning Optimal Projections onto Spectral Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03157v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional nonlinear systems pose considerable challenges for modeling and control across many domains, from fluid mechanics to advanced robotics. Such systems are typically approximated with reduced-order models, which often rely on orthogonal projections, a simplification that may lead to large prediction errors. In this work, we derive optimality of fiber-aligned projections onto spectral submanifolds, preserving the nonlinear geometric structure and minimizing long-term prediction error. We propose a data-driven procedure to learn these projections from trajectories and demonstrate its effectiveness through a 180-dimensional robotic system. Our reduced-order models achieve up to fivefold improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoencoder-based non-intrusive model order reduction in continuum mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02237v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters. To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive. These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v4)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00294v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</p></details> |  |

Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally, moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

A core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii) specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple, task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required to design DTs. In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models. It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

Building on this insight, we propose a universal preconditioning method that convolves the input with coefficients from orthogonal polynomials such as Chebyshev or Legendre. We prove that this approach reduces regret for two distinct prediction algorithms and yields the first ever sublinear and hidden-dimension independent regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) that hold for systems with marginally stable and asymmetric transition matrices. Finally, extensive synthetic and real-world experiments show that this simple preconditioning strategy improves the performance of a diverse range of algorithms, including recurrent neural networks, and generalizes to signals beyond linear dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Predicting symbolic ODEs from multiple trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23295v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at: 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Permutation Equivariant Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20324v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs, which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces. This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks, showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-order Computation of Floquet Multipliers and Subspaces using Multistep Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23082v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient computation of Floquet multipliers and subspaces is essential for analyzing limit cycle in dynamical systems and periodic steady state in Radio Frequency (RF) simulation. This problem is typically addressed by solving a periodic linear eigenvalue problem, which is discretized from the linear periodic time-varying system using one-step methods. The backward Euler method offers a computationally inexpensive overall workflow but has limited accuracy. In contrast, one-step collocation methods achieve higher accuracy through over-sampling, explicit matrix construction, and condensation, thus become costly for large-scale sparse cases. We apply multistep methods to derive a periodic polynomial eigenvalue problem, which introduces additional spurious eigenvalues. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that as the stepsize decreases, the computed Floquet multipliers and their associated invariant subspace converge with higher order, while the spurious eigenvalues converge to zero. To efficiently solve large-scale problems, we propose pTOAR, a memory-efficient iterative algorithm for computing the dominant Floquet eigenpairs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that multistep methods achieves high order accuracy, while its computational and memory costs are only marginally higher than those of the backward Euler method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Numerical Spectrum Linking: Identification of Governing PDE via Koopman-Chebyshev Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23078v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Perturbation Function Iteration Method: A New Framework for Solving Periodic Solutions of Non-linear and Non-smooth Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23071v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing accurate periodic responses in strongly nonlinear or even non-smooth vibration systems remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Existing numerical methods, such as the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and the Shooting Method (SM), have achieved notable success but face intrinsic limitations when applied to complex, high-dimensional, or non-smooth systems. A key bottleneck is the construction of Jacobian matrices for the associated algebraic equations; although numerical approximations can avoid explicit analytical derivation, they become unreliable and computationally expensive for large-scale or non-smooth problems. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the Perturbation Function Iteration Method (PFIM), a novel framework built upon perturbation theory. PFIM transforms nonlinear equations into time-varying linear systems and solves their periodic responses via a piecewise constant approximation scheme. Unlike HBM, PFIM avoids the trade-off between Fourier truncation errors and the Gibbs phenomenon in non-smooth problems by employing a basis-free iterative formulation, while significantly simplifying the Jacobian computation. Extensive numerical studies, including self-excited systems, parameter continuation, systems with varying smoothness, and high-dimensional finite element models, demonstrate that PFIM achieves quadratic convergence in smooth systems and maintains robust linear convergence in highly non-smooth cases. Moreover, comparative analyses show that, for high-dimensional non-smooth systems, PFIM attains solutions of comparable accuracy with computational costs up to two orders of magnitude lower than HBM. These results indicate that PFIM provides a robust and efficient alternative for periodic response analysis in complex nonlinear dynamical systems, with strong potential for practical engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
