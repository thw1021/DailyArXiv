| **[Dynamic Simulation of Splashing Fluids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06087v1)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we describe a method for modeling the dynamic behavior of splashing fluids. The model simulates the behavior of a fluid when objects impact or float on its surface. The forces generated by the objects create waves and splashes on the surface of the fluid. To demonstrate the realism and limitations of the model, images from a computer-generated animation are presented and compared with video frames of actual splashes occurring under similar initial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Alter...</summary><p>Alternative location: http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Obrien-DSS-1995-04</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Fluid Dynamics via Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04446v1)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans have a strong intuitive understanding of physical processes such as fluid falling by just a glimpse of such a scene picture, i.e., quickly derived from our immersive visual experiences in memory. This work achieves such a photo-to-fluid-dynamics reconstruction functionality learned from unannotated videos, without any supervision of ground-truth fluid dynamics. In a nutshell, a differentiable Euler simulator modeled with a ConvNet-based pressure projection solver, is integrated with a volumetric renderer, supporting end-to-end/coherent differentiable dynamic simulation and rendering. By endowing each sampled point with a fluid volume value, we derive a NeRF-like differentiable renderer dedicated from fluid data; and thanks to this volume-augmented representation, fluid dynamics could be inversely inferred from the error signal between the rendered result and ground-truth video frame (i.e., inverse rendering). Experiments on our generated Fluid Fall datasets and DPI Dam Break dataset are conducted to demonstrate both effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLUID-LLM: Learning Computational Fluid Dynamics with Spatiotemporal-aware Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04501v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning computational fluid dynamics (CFD) traditionally relies on computationally intensive simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable pattern recognition and reasoning abilities in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, these models struggle with the complex geometries inherent in fluid dynamics. We introduce FLUID-LLM, a novel framework combining pre-trained LLMs with spatiotemporal-aware encoding to predict unsteady fluid dynamics. Our approach leverages the temporal autoregressive abilities of LLMs alongside spatial-aware layers, bridging the gap between previous CFD prediction methods. Evaluations on standard benchmarks reveal significant performance improvements across various fluid datasets. Our results demonstrate that FLUID-LLM effectively integrates spatiotemporal information into pre-trained LLMs, enhancing CFD task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDBB: Fluid Dynamics Building Blocks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09851v1)** | 2018-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing platforms are becoming more and more heterogeneous, which makes it very difficult for researchers and scientific software developers to keep up with the rapid changes on the hardware market. In this paper, the open-source project FDBB (Fluid Dynamics Building Blocks) is presented, which eases the development of fluid dynamics applications for heterogeneous systems. It consists of a low-level API that provides a unified interface to many different linear algebra back-ends and a lightweight and extendible high-level expression template library, which provides largely customizable fluid dynamics building blocks, like transformations between primary and secondary variables as well as expressions for Riemann invariants, equations of state, inviscid fluxes and their flux-Jacobians. The performance of the developed approach is assessed both for synthetic micro-benchmarks and within mini-applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inpainting Computational Fluid Dynamics with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17185v1)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid data completion is a research problem with high potential benefit for both experimental and computational fluid dynamics. An effective fluid data completion method reduces the required number of sensors in a fluid dynamics experiment, and allows a coarser and more adaptive mesh for a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. However, the ill-posed nature of the fluid data completion problem makes it prohibitively difficult to obtain a theoretical solution and presents high numerical uncertainty and instability for a data-driven approach (e.g., a neural network model). To address these challenges, we leverage recent advancements in computer vision, employing the vector quantization technique to map both complete and incomplete fluid data spaces onto discrete-valued lower-dimensional representations via a two-stage learning procedure. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on Kolmogorov flow data (Reynolds number: 1000) occluded by masks of different size and arrangement. Experimental results show that our proposed model consistently outperforms benchmark models under different occlusion settings in terms of point-wise reconstruction accuracy as well as turbulent energy spectrum and vorticity distribution.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SPNets: Differentiable Fluid Dynamics for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06094v2)** | 2018-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we introduce Smooth Particle Networks (SPNets), a framework for integrating fluid dynamics with deep networks. SPNets adds two new layers to the neural network toolbox: ConvSP and ConvSDF, which enable computing physical interactions with unordered particle sets. We use these lay- ers in combination with standard neural network layers to directly implement fluid dynamics inside a deep network, where the parameters of the network are the fluid parameters themselves (e.g., viscosity, cohesion, etc.). Because SPNets are imple- mented as a neural network, the resulting fluid dynamics are fully differentiable. We then show how this can be successfully used to learn fluid parameters from data, perform liquid control tasks, and learn policies to manipulate liquids.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2018</p></details> |
| **[HelmFluid: Learning Helmholtz Dynamics for Interpretable Fluid Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10565v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid prediction is a long-standing challenge due to the intrinsic high-dimensional non-linear dynamics. Previous methods usually utilize the non-linear modeling capability of deep models to directly estimate velocity fields for future prediction. However, skipping over inherent physical properties but directly learning superficial velocity fields will overwhelm the model from generating precise or physics-reliable results. In this paper, we propose the HelmFluid toward an accurate and interpretable predictor for fluid. Inspired by the Helmholtz theorem, we design a HelmDynamics block to learn Helmholtz dynamics, which decomposes fluid dynamics into more solvable curl-free and divergence-free parts, physically corresponding to potential and stream functions of fluid. By embedding the HelmDynamics block into a Multiscale Multihead Integral Architecture, HelmFluid can integrate learned Helmholtz dynamics along temporal dimension in multiple spatial scales to yield future fluid. Compared with previous velocity estimating methods, HelmFluid is faithfully derived from Helmholtz theorem and ravels out complex fluid dynamics with physically interpretable evidence. Experimentally, HelmFluid achieves consistent state-of-the-art in both numerical simulated and real-world observed benchmarks, even for scenarios with complex boundaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Planning for Fluid Manipulation using Simplified Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02347v1)** | 2016-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimization-based motion planning algorithm to compute a smooth, collision-free trajectory for a manipulator used to transfer a liquid from a source to a target container. We take into account fluid dynamics constraints as part of trajectory computation. In order to avoid the high complexity of exact fluid simulation, we introduce a simplified dynamics model based on physically inspired approximations and system identification. Our optimization approach can incorporate various other constraints such as collision avoidance with the obstacles, kinematic and dynamics constraints of the manipulator, and fluid dynamics characteristics. We demonstrate the performance of our planner on different benchmarks corresponding to various obstacles and container shapes. Furthermore, we also evaluate its accuracy by validating the motion plan using an accurate but computationally costly Navier-Stokes fluid simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02425v5)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as meteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually observed from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of adaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for fluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a transparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks covering 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/DeepLag.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prospects of federated machine learning in fluid dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07017v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-based models have been mainstream in fluid dynamics for developing predictive models. In recent years, machine learning has offered a renaissance to the fluid community due to the rapid developments in data science, processing units, neural network based technologies, and sensor adaptations. So far in many applications in fluid dynamics, machine learning approaches have been mostly focused on a standard process that requires centralizing the training data on a designated machine or in a data center. In this letter, we present a federated machine learning approach that enables localized clients to collaboratively learn an aggregated and shared predictive model while keeping all the training data on each edge device. We demonstrate the feasibility and prospects of such decentralized learning approach with an effort to forge a deep learning surrogate model for reconstructing spatiotemporal fields. Our results indicate that federated machine learning might be a viable tool for designing highly accurate predictive decentralized digital twins relevant to fluid dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2207.12245</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Computational Fluid Dynamics with Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02085v2)** | 2022-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is rapidly becoming a core technology for scientific computing, with numerous opportunities to advance the field of computational fluid dynamics. In this Perspective, we highlight some of the areas of highest potential impact, including to accelerate direct numerical simulations, to improve turbulence closure modeling, and to develop enhanced reduced-order models. We also discuss emerging areas of machine learning that are promising for computational fluid dynamics, as well as some potential limitations that should be taken into account.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Bayesian model reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07092v2)** | 2019-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reviews recent developments in statistical structure learning; namely, Bayesian model reduction. Bayesian model reduction is a method for rapidly computing the evidence and parameters of probabilistic models that differ only in their priors. In the setting of variational Bayes this has an analytical solution, which finesses the problem of scoring large model spaces in model comparison or structure learning. In this technical note, we review Bayesian model reduction and provide the relevant equations for several discrete and continuous probability distributions. We provide worked examples in the context of multivariate linear regression, Gaussian mixture models and dynamical systems (dynamic causal modelling). These examples are accompanied by the Matlab scripts necessary to reproduce the results. Finally, we briefly review recent applications in the fields of neuroimaging and neuroscience. Specifically, we consider structure learning and hierarchical or empirical Bayes that can be regarded as a metaphor for neurobiological processes like abductive reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been thoroughly updated, including more detailed explanations, additional derivations and three worked examples</p></details> |

In this paper, we describe the MORLAB, Model Order Reduction LABoratory, toolbox as an efficient implementation of model reduction techniques for dense, medium-scale linear time-invariant systems. Giving an introduction to the underlying programming principles of the toolbox, we show the basic idea of spectral splitting and present an overview about implemented model reduction techniques. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate different use cases of the MORLAB toolbox.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Simulation reductions for the Ising model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.2151v1)** | 2009-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polynomial time reductions between problems have long been used to delineate problem classes. Simulation reductions also exist, where an oracle for simulation from some probability distribution can be employed together with an oracle for Bernoulli draws in order to obtain a draw from a different distribution. Here linear time simulation reductions are given for: the Ising spins world to the Ising subgraphs world and the Ising subgraphs world to the Ising spins world. This answers a long standing question of whether such a direct relationship between these two versions of the Ising model existed. Moreover, these reductions result in the first method for perfect simulation from the subgraphs world and a new Swendsen-Wang style Markov chain for the Ising model. The method used is to write the desired distribution with set parameters as a mixture of distributions where the parameters are at their extreme values.</p></details> | 12 pages; 1 figure |
| **[Model Order Reduction for Gas and Energy Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12099v3)** | 2021-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To counter the volatile nature of renewable energy sources, gas networks take a vital role. But, to ensure fulfillment of contracts under these circumstances, a vast number of possible scenarios, incorporating uncertain supply and demand, has to be simulated ahead of time. This many-query gas network simulation task can be accelerated by model reduction, yet, large-scale, nonlinear, parametric, hyperbolic partial differential(-algebraic) equation systems, modeling natural gas transport, are a challenging application for model order reduction algorithms. For this industrial application, we bring together the scientific computing topics of: mathematical modeling of gas transport networks, numerical simulation of hyperbolic partial differential equation, and parametric model reduction for nonlinear systems. This research resulted in the "morgen" (Model Order Reduction for Gas and Energy Networks) software platform, which enables modular testing of various combinations of models, solvers, and model reduction methods. In this work we present the theoretical background on systemic modeling and structured, data-driven, system-theoretic model reduction for gas networks, as well as the implementation of "morgen" and associated numerical experiments testing model reduction adapted to gas network models.</p></details> |  |
| **[STV+Reductions: Towards Practical Verification of Strategic Ability Using Model Reductions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18418v1)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a substantially expanded version of our tool STV for strategy synthesis and verification of strategic abilities.

| **[Dynamic Reductions for Model Checking Concurrent Software](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09318v1)** | 2016-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic model checking of parallel programs stands and falls with effective methods of dealing with the explosion of interleavings. We propose a dynamic reduction technique to avoid unnecessary interleavings. By extending Lipton's original work with a notion of bisimilarity, we accommodate dynamic transactions, and thereby reduce dependence on the accuracy of static analysis, which is a severe bottleneck in other reduction techniques. The combination of symbolic model checking and dynamic reduction techniques has proven to be challenging in the past. Our generic reduction theorem nonetheless enables us to derive an efficient symbolic encoding, which we implemented for IC3 and BMC. The experiments demonstrate the power of dynamic reduction on several case studies and a large set of SVCOMP benchmarks.</p></details> | 38 pages |

The model-order reduction method is based on the Kron reduction of the weighted Laplacian matrix which describes the graph structure of complexes in the chemical reaction network. We apply our method to a yeast glycolysis model, where the simulation result shows that the transient behaviour of a number of key metabolites of the reduced-order model is in good agreement with those of the full-order model.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1211.6643, arXiv:1110.6078</p></details> |
| **[Simplifying Dependent Reductions in the Polyhedral Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11203v2)** | 2021-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Reduction -- an accumulation over a set of values, using an associative and commutative operator -- is a common computation in many numerical computations, including scientific computations, machine learning, computer vision, and financial analytics. Contemporary polyhedral-based compilation techniques make it possible to optimize reductions, such as prefix sums, in which each component of the reduction's output potentially shares computation with another component in the reduction. Therefore an optimizing compiler can identify the computation shared between multiple components and generate code that computes the shared computation only once. These techniques, however, do not support reductions that -- when phrased in the language of the polyhedral model -- span multiple dependent statements. In such cases, existing approaches can generate incorrect code that violates the data dependences of the original, unoptimized program. In this work, we identify and formalize the optimization of dependent reductions as an integer bilinear program. We present a heuristic optimization algorithm that uses an affine sequential schedule of the program to determine how to simplfy reductions yet still preserve the program's dependences. We demonstrate that the algorithm provides optimal complexity for a set of benchmark programs from the literature on probabilistic inference algorithms, whose performance critically relies on simplifying these reductions. The complexities for 10 of the 11 programs improve siginifcantly by factors at least of the sizes of the input data, which are in the range of $10^4$ to $10^6$ for typical real application inputs. We also confirm the significance of the improvement by showing speedups in wall-clock time that range from $1.1\text{x}$ to over $10^6\text{x}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterexample-Preserving Reduction for Symbolic Model Checking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3299v1)** | 2013-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cost of LTL model checking is highly sensitive to the length of the formula under verification. We observe that, under some specific conditions, the input LTL formula can be reduced to an easier-to-handle one before model checking. In our reduction, these two formulae need not to be logically equivalent, but they share the same counterexample set w.r.t the model. In the case that the model is symbolically represented, the condition enabling such reduction can be detected with a lightweight effort (e.g., with SAT-solving). In this paper, we tentatively name such technique "Counterexample-Preserving Reduction" (CePRe for short), and finally the proposed technquie is experimentally evaluated by adapting NuSMV.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Statistical Model for Melody Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05385v1)** | 2021-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A commonly-cited reason for the poor performance of automatic chord estimation (ACE) systems within music information retrieval (MIR) is that non-chord tones (i.e., notes outside the supporting harmony) contribute to error during the labeling process. Despite the prevalence of machine learning approaches in MIR, there are cases where alternative approaches provide a simpler alternative while allowing for insights into musicological practices. In this project, we present a statistical model for predicting chord tones based on music theory rules. Our model is currently focused on predicting chord tones in classical music, since composition in this style is highly constrained, theoretically making the placement of chord tones highly predictable. Indeed, music theorists have labeling systems for every variety of non-chord tone, primarily classified by the note's metric position and intervals of approach and departure. Using metric position, duration, and melodic intervals as predictors, we build a statistical model for predicting chord tones using the TAVERN dataset. While our probabilistic approach is similar to other efforts in the domain of automatic harmonic analysis, our focus is on melodic reduction rather than predicting harmony. However, we hope to pursue applications for ACE in the future. Finally, we implement our melody reduction model using an existing symbolic visualization tool, to assist with melody reduction and non-chord tone identification for computational musicology researchers and music theorists.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Dimension Reduction of Large AND-NOT Network Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6868v1)** | 2013-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean networks have been used successfully in modeling biological networks and provide a good framework for theoretical analysis. However, the analysis of large networks is not trivial. In order to simplify the analysis of such networks, several model reduction algorithms have been proposed; however, it is not clear if such algorithms scale well with respect to the number of nodes. The goal of this paper is to propose and implement an algorithm for the reduction of AND-NOT network models for the purpose of steady state computation. Our method of network reduction is the use of "steady state approximations" that do not change the number of steady states. Our algorithm is designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or simplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The main features of our algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level, it runs in polynomial time, and it preserves the number of steady states. We used our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed that our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis. Furthermore, our algorithm can handle sparse AND-NOT networks with up to 1000000 nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[NP-Logic Systems and Model-Equivalence Reductions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.0403v1)** | 2010-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we investigate the existence of model-equivalence reduction between NP-logic systems which are logic systems with model existence problem in NP. It is shown that among all NP-systems with model checking problem in NP, the existentially quantified propositional logic (\exists PF) is maximal with respect to poly-time model-equivalent reduction. However, \exists PF seems not a maximal NP-system in general because there exits a NP-system with model checking problem D^P-complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact hierarchical reductions of dynamical models via linear transformations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11653v2)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical models described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a fundamental tool in the sciences and engineering. Exact reduction aims at producing a lower-dimensional model in which each macro-variable can be directly related to the original variables, and it is thus a natural step towards the model's formal analysis and mechanistic understanding. We present an algorithm which, given a polynomial ODE model, computes a longest possible chain of exact linear reductions of the model such that each reduction refines the previous one, thus giving a user control of the level of detail preserved by the reduction. This significantly generalizes over the existing approaches which compute only the reduction of the lowest dimension subject to an approach-specific constraint. The algorithm reduces finding exact linear reductions to a question about representations of finite-dimensional algebras. We provide an implementation of the algorithm, demonstrate its performance on a set of benchmarks, and illustrate the applicability via case studies. Our implementation is freely available at https://github.com/x3042/ExactODEReduction.jl</p></details> |  |
| **[Symplectic Autoencoders for Model Reduction of Hamiltonian Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10004v1)** | 2023-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification and inverse problems, require repeatedly performing simulations of large-dimensional physical systems for different choices of parameters. This can be prohibitively expensive. In order to save computational cost, one can construct surrogate models by expressing the system in a low-dimensional basis, obtained from training data. This is referred to as model reduction. Past investigations have shown that, when performing model reduction of Hamiltonian systems, it is crucial to preserve the symplectic structure associated with the system in order to ensure long-term numerical stability. Up to this point structure-preserving reductions have largely been limited to linear transformations. We propose a new neural network architecture in the spirit of autoencoders, which are established tools for dimension reduction and feature extraction in data science, to obtain more general mappings. In order to train the network, a non-standard gradient descent approach is applied that leverages the differential-geometric structure emerging from the network design. The new architecture is shown to significantly outperform existing designs in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are a notable architecture in this field.

We extend this idea towards nonlinear model order reduction by proposing an efficient framework that combines neural networks with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for operator learning.

| **[Data-driven model reduction for stochastic Burgers equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00736v2)** | 2020-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a class of efficient parametric closure models for 1D stochastic Burgers equations. Casting it as statistical learning of the flow map, we derive the parametric form by representing the unresolved high wavenumber Fourier modes as functionals of the resolved variables' trajectory. The reduced models are nonlinear autoregression (NAR) time series models, with coefficients estimated from data by least squares. The NAR models can accurately reproduce the energy spectrum, the invariant densities, and the autocorrelations. Taking advantage of the simplicity of the NAR models, we investigate maximal and optimal space-time reduction. Reduction in space dimension is unlimited, and NAR models with two Fourier modes can perform well. The NAR model's stability limits time reduction, with a maximal time step smaller than that of the K-mode Galerkin system. We report a potential criterion for optimal space-time reduction: the NAR models achieve minimal relative error in the energy spectrum at the time step where the K-mode Galerkin system's mean CFL number agrees with the full model's.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Mean and median bias reduction in generalized linear models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04085v4)** | 2019-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an integrated framework for estimation and inference from generalized linear models using adjusted score equations that result in mean and median bias reduction. The framework unifies theoretical and methodological aspects of past research on mean bias reduction and accommodates, in a natural way, new advances on median bias reduction. General expressions for the adjusted score functions are derived in terms of quantities that are readily available in standard software for fitting generalized linear models. The resulting estimating equations are solved using a unifying quasi-Fisher scoring algorithm that is shown to be equivalent to iteratively re-weighted least squares with appropriately adjusted working variates. Formal links between the iterations for mean and median bias reduction are established. Core model invariance properties are used to develop a novel mixed adjustment strategy when the estimation of a dispersion parameter is necessary. It is also shown how median bias reduction in multinomial logistic regression can be done using the equivalent Poisson log-linear model. The estimates coming out from mean and median bias reduction are found to overcome practical issues related to infinite estimates that can occur with positive probability in generalized linear models with multinomial or discrete responses, and can result in valid inferences even in the presence of a high-dimensional nuisance parameter</p></details> |  |
| **[MBS: Macroblock Scaling for CNN Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06569v2)** | 2019-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose the macroblock scaling (MBS) algorithm, which can be applied to various CNN architectures to reduce their model size. MBS adaptively reduces each CNN macroblock depending on its information redundancy measured by our proposed effective flops. Empirical studies conducted with ImageNet and CIFAR-10 attest that MBS can reduce the model size of some already compact CNN models, e.g., MobileNetV2 (25.03% further reduction) and ShuffleNet (20.74%), and even ultra-deep ones such as ResNet-101 (51.67%) and ResNet-1202 (72.71%) with negligible accuracy degradation. MBS also performs better reduction at a much lower cost than the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods do. MBS's simplicity and efficiency, its flexibility to work with any CNN model, and its scalability to work with models of any depth make it an attractive choice for CNN model size reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (Accepted by CVPR'19)</p></details> |
| **[Heuristic algorithms for finding distribution reducts in probabilistic rough set model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07162v1)** | 2015-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute reduction is one of the most important topics in rough set theory. Heuristic attribute reduction algorithms have been presented to solve the attribute reduction problem. It is generally known that fitness functions play a key role in developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. The monotonicity of fitness functions can guarantee the validity of heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. In probabilistic rough set model, distribution reducts can ensure the decision rules derived from the reducts are compatible with those derived from the original decision table. However, there are few studies on developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution reducts. This is partly due to the fact that there are no monotonic fitness functions that are used to design heuristic attribute reduction algorithms in probabilistic rough set model. The main objective of this paper is to develop heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution reducts in probabilistic rough set model. For one thing, two monotonic fitness functions are constructed, from which equivalence definitions of distribution reducts can be obtained. For another, two modified monotonic fitness functions are proposed to evaluate the significance of attributes more effectively. On this basis, two heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution reducts are developed based on addition-deletion method and deletion method. In particular, the monotonicity of fitness functions guarantees the rationality of the proposed heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. Results of experimental analysis are included to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed fitness functions and distribution reducts.</p></details> | 44 pages, 24 figures |

Building on the recent development of the GPT-PINN that is a network-of-networks design achieving snapshot-based model reduction, we design and test a novel paradigm for nonlinear model reduction that can effectively tackle problems with parameter-dependent discontinuities. Through incorporation of a shock-capturing loss function component as well as a parameter-dependent transform layer, the TGPT-PINN overcomes the limitations of linear model reduction in the transport-dominated regime. We demonstrate this new capability for nonlinear model reduction in the PINNs framework by several nontrivial parametric partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[pyMOR - Generic Algorithms and Interfaces for Model Order Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07094v3)** | 2019-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced basis methods are projection-based model order reduction techniques for reducing the computational complexity of solving parametrized partial differential equation problems. In this work we discuss the design of pyMOR, a freely available software library of model order reduction algorithms, in particular reduced basis methods, implemented with the Python programming language. As its main design feature, all reduction algorithms in pyMOR are implemented generically via operations on well-defined vector array, operator and discretization interface classes. This allows for an easy integration with existing open-source high-performance partial differential equation solvers without adding any model reduction specific code to these solvers. Besides an in-depth discussion of pyMOR's design philosophy and architecture, we present several benchmark results and numerical examples showing the feasibility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cox reduction and confidence sets of models: a theoretical elucidation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12627v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For sparse high-dimensional regression problems, Cox and Battey [1, 9] emphasised the need for confidence sets of models: an enumeration of those small sets of variables that fit the data equivalently well in a suitable statistical sense. This is to be contrasted with the single model returned by penalised regression procedures, effective for prediction but potentially misleading for subject-matter understanding. The proposed construction of such sets relied on preliminary reduction of the full set of variables, and while various possibilities could be considered for this, [9] proposed a succession of regression fits based on incomplete block designs. The purpose of the present paper is to provide insight on both aspects of that work. For an unspecified reduction strategy, we begin by characterising models that are likely to be retained in the model confidence set, emphasising geometric aspects. We then evaluate possible reduction schemes based on penalised regression or marginal screening, before theoretically elucidating the reduction of [9]. We identify features of the covariate matrix that may reduce its efficacy, and indicate improvements to the original proposal. An advantage of the approach is its ability to reveal its own stability or fragility for the data at hand.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we provide computationally efficient procedures that approximately reduce uniform, Erlang, and Laplace location models to general target families. We illustrate our methodology by establishing nonasymptotic reductions between some canonical high-dimensional problems, spanning mixtures of experts, phase retrieval, and signal denoising. Notably, the reductions are structure-preserving and can accommodate missing data. We also point to a possible application in transforming one differentially private mechanism to another.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 co...</summary><p>v2 contains numerical illustrations and more exposition in narrative</p></details> |

To overcome these costs, model order reduction techniques can be applied. The focus of this contribution is especially on machines that contain non-symmetric components. These are usually introduced during the mass production process and are modeled by small perturbations in the geometry (e.g., eccentricity) or the material parameters. While model order reduction for symmetric machines is clear and does not need special treatment, the non-symmetric setting adds additional challenges. An adaptive strategy based on proper orthogonal decomposition is developed to overcome these difficulties. Equipped with an a posteriori error estimator the obtained solution is certified. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reduced-Order Modeling Of Hidden Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02267v2)** | 2018-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this paper is to investigate how noisy and incomplete observations can be integrated in the process of building a reduced-order model. This problematic arises in many scientific domains where there exists a need for accurate low-order descriptions of highly-complex phenomena, which can not be directly and/or deterministically observed. Within this context, the paper proposes a probabilistic framework for the construction of "POD-Galerkin" reduced-order models. Assuming a hidden Markov chain, the inference integrates the uncertainty of the hidden states relying on their posterior distribution. Simulations show the benefits obtained by exploiting the proposed framework.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Convolutional Autoencoders for Reduced-Order Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12453v1)** | 2021-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the construction of reduced-order models for dynamical systems, linear projection methods, such as proper orthogonal decompositions, are commonly employed. However, for many dynamical systems, the lower dimensional representation of the state space can most accurately be described by a \textit{nonlinear} manifold. Previous research has shown that deep learning can provide an efficient method for performing nonlinear dimension reduction, though they are dependent on the availability of training data and are often problem-specific \citep[see][]{carlberg_ca}. Here, we utilize randomized training data to create and train convolutional autoencoders that perform nonlinear dimension reduction for the wave and Kuramoto-Shivasinsky equations. Moreover, we present training methods that are independent of full-order model samples and use the manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection method to define a reduced-order model for the heat, wave, and Kuramoto-Shivasinsky equations using the same autoencoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[The ROMES method for statistical modeling of reduced-order-model error](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5170v3)** | 2015-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a technique for statistically modeling errors introduced by reduced-order models. The method employs Gaussian-process regression to construct a mapping from a small number of computationally inexpensive `error indicators' to a distribution over the true error. The variance of this distribution can be interpreted as the (epistemic) uncertainty introduced by the reduced-order model. To model normed errors, the method employs existing rigorous error bounds and residual norms as indicators; numerical experiments show that the method leads to a near-optimal expected effectivity in contrast to typical error bounds. To model errors in general outputs, the method uses dual-weighted residuals---which are amenable to uncertainty control---as indicators. Experiments illustrate that correcting the reduced-order-model output with this surrogate can improve prediction accuracy by an order of magnitude; this contrasts with existing `multifidelity correction' approaches, which often fail for reduced-order models and suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The proposed error surrogates also lead to a notion of `probabilistic rigor', i.e., the surrogate bounds the error with specified probability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model for an importance sampling estimator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07977v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we develop an importance sampling estimator by coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical reduced order modelling for the parametric Helmholtz equation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04438v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, associated code available at https://github.com/herluc/statROM.

| **[Bayesian operator inference for data-driven reduced-order modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10829v2)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a Bayesian inference method for the reduced-order modeling of time-dependent systems. Informed by the structure of the governing equations, the task of learning a reduced-order model from data is posed as a Bayesian inverse problem with Gaussian prior and likelihood. The resulting posterior distribution characterizes the operators defining the reduced-order model, hence the predictions subsequently issued by the reduced-order model are endowed with uncertainty. The statistical moments of these predictions are estimated via a Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution. Since the reduced models are fast to solve, this sampling is computationally efficient. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian framework provides a statistical interpretation of the regularization term that is present in the deterministic operator inference problem, and the empirical Bayes approach of maximum marginal likelihood suggests a selection algorithm for the regularization hyperparameters. The proposed method is demonstrated on two examples: the compressible Euler equations with noise-corrupted observations, and a single-injector combustion process.</p></details> |  |

Despite their computational advantages, reduced order models (ROMs) often fail to accurately reproduce complex dynamics encountered in real life applications. To address this challenge, we leverage NeuralODEs to propose a novel ROM correction approach based on a time-continuous memory formulation. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed method provides a high level of accuracy while retaining the low computational costs inherent to reduced models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hyper-reduction for Petrov-Galerkin reduced order models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16267v1)** | 2023-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based Reduced Order Models minimize the discrete residual of a "full order model" (FOM) while constraining the unknowns to a reduced dimension space. For problems with symmetric positive definite (SPD) Jacobians, this is optimally achieved by projecting the full order residual onto the approximation basis (Galerkin Projection). This is sub-optimal for non-SPD Jacobians as it only minimizes the projection of the residual, not the residual itself. An alternative is to directly minimize the 2-norm of the residual, achievable using QR factorization or the method of the normal equations (LSPG). The first approach involves constructing and factorizing a large matrix, while LSPG avoids this but requires constructing a product element by element, necessitating a complementary mesh and adding complexity to the hyper-reduction process. This work proposes an alternative based on Petrov-Galerkin minimization. We choose a left basis for a least-squares minimization on a reduced problem, ensuring the discrete full order residual is minimized. This is applicable to both SPD and non-SPD Jacobians, allowing element-by-element assembly, avoiding the use of a complementary mesh, and simplifying finite element implementation. The technique is suitable for hyper-reduction using the Empirical Cubature Method and is applicable in nonlinear reduction procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stable FDTD Method with Embedded Reduced-Order Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07114v2)** | 2021-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational efficiency of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method can be significantly reduced by the presence of complex objects with fine features. Small geometrical details impose a fine mesh and a reduced time step, significantly increasing computational cost. Model order reduction has been proposed as a systematic way to generate compact models for complex objects, that one can then instantiate into a main FDTD mesh. However, the stability of FDTD with embedded reduced models remains an open problem. We propose a systematic method to generate reduced models for FDTD domains, and embed them into a main FDTD mesh with guaranteed stability up to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) limit of the fine mesh. With a simple perturbation technique, the CFL of the whole scheme can be further extended beyond the fine grid's CFL limit. Reduced models can be created for arbitrary domains containing inhomogeneous and lossy materials. Numerical tests confirm the stability of the proposed method, and its potential to accelerate multiscale FDTD simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation</p></details> |
| **[Multi-fidelity reduced-order surrogate modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00325v1)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity numerical simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) given a restricted computational budget can significantly limit the number of parameter configurations considered and/or time window evaluated for modeling a given system. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling aims to leverage less accurate, lower-fidelity models that are computationally inexpensive in order to enhance predictive accuracy when high-fidelity data are limited or scarce. However, low-fidelity models, while often displaying important qualitative spatio-temporal features, fail to accurately capture the onset of instability and critical transients observed in the high-fidelity models, making them impractical as surrogate models. To address this shortcoming, we present a new data-driven strategy that combines dimensionality reduction with multi-fidelity neural network surrogates. The key idea is to generate a spatial basis by applying the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to high-fidelity solution snapshots, and approximate the dynamics of the reduced states - time-parameter-dependent expansion coefficients of the POD basis - using a multi-fidelity long-short term memory (LSTM) network. By mapping low-fidelity reduced states to their high-fidelity counterpart, the proposed reduced-order surrogate model enables the efficient recovery of full solution fields over time and parameter variations in a non-intrusive manner. The generality and robustness of this method is demonstrated by a collection of parametrized, time-dependent PDE problems where the low-fidelity model can be defined by coarser meshes and/or time stepping, as well as by misspecified physical features. Importantly, the onset of instabilities and transients are well captured by this surrogate modeling technique.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Domain Walking with Reduced-Order Models of Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03179v1)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing inspiration from human multi-domain walking, this work presents a novel reduced-order model based framework for realizing multi-domain robotic walking. At the core of our approach is the viewpoint that human walking can be represented by a hybrid dynamical system, with continuous phases that are fully-actuated, under-actuated, and over-actuated and discrete changes in actuation type occurring with changes in contact. Leveraging this perspective, we synthesize a multi-domain linear inverted pendulum (MLIP) model of locomotion. Utilizing the step-to-step dynamics of the MLIP model, we successfully demonstrate multi-domain walking behaviors on the bipedal robot Cassie -- a high degree of freedom 3D bipedal robot. Thus, we show the ability to bridge the gap between multi-domain reduced order models and full-order multi-contact locomotion. Additionally, our results showcase the ability of the proposed method to achieve versatile speed-tracking performance and robust push recovery behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ACC 2024</p></details> |

Very few works applying reduced-order models are available in the literature.

A classical magnetodynamic finite element formulation based on the magnetic vector potential is used as reference and to build up the reduced models. Two approaches are proposed. The TEAM workshop problem 28 is chosen as a test case for validation. Results are compared in terms of accuracy and computational cost.</p></details> | Accepted |

With this as motivation, this paper presents a safety-critical control framework that leverages reduced order models to ensure safety on the full order dynamics -- even when these models are subject to disturbances and bounded inputs (e.g., actuation limits). To handle input constraints, the backup set method is reformulated in the context of reduced order models, and conditions for the provably safe behavior of the full order system are derived. Then, the input-to-state safe backup set method is introduced to provide robustness against discrepancies between the reduced order model and the actual system. Finally, the proposed framework is demonstrated in high-fidelity simulation, where a quadrupedal robot is safely navigated around an obstacle with legged locomotion by the help of the unicycle model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2023 American Control Conference (ACC). 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

This paper explores a deep autoencoding learning method for reduced-order modeling and control of dynamical systems governed by spatiotemporal PDEs. We first analytically show that an optimization objective for learning a linear autoencoding reduced-order model can be formulated to yield a solution closely resembling the result obtained through the dynamic mode decomposition with control algorithm. We then extend this linear autoencoding architecture to a deep autoencoding framework, enabling the development of a nonlinear reduced-order model. Furthermore, we leverage the learned reduced-order model to design controllers using stability-constrained deep neural networks. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the efficacy of our approach in both modeling and control using the example of a reaction-diffusion system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Generative Adversarial Reduced Order Modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15881v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present GAROM, a new approach for reduced order modelling (ROM) based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs have the potential to learn data distribution and generate more realistic data. While widely applied in many areas of deep learning, little research is done on their application for ROM, i.e. approximating a high-fidelity model with a simpler one. In this work, we combine the GAN and ROM framework, by introducing a data-driven generative adversarial model able to learn solutions to parametric differential equations. The latter is achieved by modelling the discriminator network as an autoencoder, extracting relevant features of the input, and applying a conditioning mechanism to the generator and discriminator networks specifying the differential equation parameters. We show how to apply our methodology for inference, provide experimental evidence of the model generalisation, and perform a convergence study of the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Nonlinear Reduced-Order Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05746v1)** | 2023-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world systems are often characterized by high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, making them challenging to control in real time. While reduced-order models (ROMs) are frequently employed in model-based control schemes, dimensionality reduction introduces model uncertainty which can potentially compromise the stability and safety of the original high-dimensional system. In this work, we propose a novel reduced-order model predictive control (ROMPC) scheme to solve constrained optimal control problems for nonlinear, high-dimensional systems. To address the challenges of using ROMs in predictive control schemes, we derive an error bounding system that dynamically accounts for model reduction error. Using these bounds, we design a robust MPC scheme that ensures robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in simulations on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, To be presented at Conference for Decision and Control 2023</p></details> |
| **[RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12814v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced-order modeling for second-order computational homogenization with applications to geometrically parameterized elastomeric metamaterials](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00437v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structural properties of mechanical metamaterials are typically studied with two-scale methods based on computational homogenization. Because such materials have a complex microstructure, enriched schemes such as second-order computational homogenization are required to fully capture their non-linear behavior, which arises from non-local interactions due to the buckling or patterning of the microstructure. In the two-scale formulation, the effective behavior of the microstructure is captured with a representative volume element (RVE), and a homogenized effective continuum is considered on the macroscale. Although an effective continuum formulation is introduced, solving such two-scale models concurrently is still computationally demanding due to the many repeated solutions for each RVE at the microscale level. In this work, we propose a reduced-order model for the microscopic problem arising in second-order computational homogenization, using proper orthogonal decomposition and a novel hyperreduction method that is specifically tailored for this problem and inspired by the empirical cubature method. Two numerical examples are considered, in which the performance of the reduced-order model is carefully assessed by comparing its solutions with direct numerical simulations (entirely resolving the underlying microstructure) and the full second-order computational homogenization model. The reduced-order model is able to approximate the result of the full computational homogenization well, provided that the training data is representative for the problem at hand. Any remaining errors, when compared with the direct numerical simulation, can be attributed to the inherent approximation errors in the computational homogenization scheme. Regarding run times for one thread, speed-ups on the order of 100 are achieved with the reduced-order model as compared to direct numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

| **[A novel reduced order model for vortex induced vibrations of long flexible cylinders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09241v1)** | 2018-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this manuscript the development of a reduced order model for the analysis of long flexible cylinders in an offshore environment is proposed. In particular the focus is on the modelling of the vortex induced vibrations (VIV) and the aim is the development of a model capable of capturing both the in-line and cross-flow oscillations. The reduced order model is identified starting from the results of a high fidelity solver developed coupling together a Finite Element Solver (FEM) with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver. The high fidelity analyses are conducted on a reduced domain size representing a small section of the long cylinder, which is nevertheless, already flexible. The section is forced using a motion which matches the expected motion in full scale, and the results are used for the system-parameter identification of the reduced order model. The reduced order model is identified by using a system and parameter identification approach. The final proposed model consists in the combination of a forced van der Pol oscillator, to model the cross-flow forces, and a linear state-space model, to model the in-line forces. The model is applied to study a full scale flexible model and the results are validated by using experiments conducted on a flexible riser inside a towing tank.</p></details> |  |

Reduced models provide a real-time numerical approximation by simplifying the original model. The error introduced by the such operation is usually neglected and sacrificed in order to reach a fast computation. We propose to couple the model reduction to a machine learning residual learning, such that the above-mentioned error can be learned by a neural network and inferred for new predictions. We emphasize that the framework maximizes the exploitation of high-fidelity information, using it for building the reduced order model and for learning the residual. In this work, we explore the integration of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and gappy POD for sensors data, with the recent DeepONet architecture. Numerical investigations for a parametric benchmark function and a nonlinear parametric Navier-Stokes problem are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[An optimization-based coupling of reduced order models with efficient reduced adjoint basis generation approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14450v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based coupling (OBC) is an attractive alternative to traditional Lagrange multiplier approaches in multiple modeling and simulation contexts. However, application of OBC to time-dependent problems has been hindered by the computational cost of finding the stationary points of the associated Lagrangian, which requires primal and adjoint solves. This issue can be mitigated by using OBC in conjunction with computationally efficient reduced order models (ROM). To demonstrate the potential of this combination, in this paper we develop an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient advection-diffusion transmission problem. We pursue the ``optimize-then-reduce'' path towards solving the minimization problem at each timestep and solve reduced-space adjoint system of equations, where the main challenge in this formulation is the generation of adjoint snapshots and reduced bases for the adjoint systems required by the optimizer. One of the main contributions of the paper is a new technique for efficient adjoint snapshot collection for gradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM couplings. We present numerical studies demonstrating the accuracy of the approach along with comparison between various approaches for selecting a reduced order basis for the adjoint systems, including decay of snapshot energy, average iteration counts, and timings.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Construction of Local Parametric Reduced Order Models Using Machine Learning Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02909v1)** | 2015-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced order models are computationally inexpensive approximations that capture the important dynamical characteristics of large, high-fidelity computer models of physical systems. This paper applies machine learning techniques to improve the design of parametric reduced order models. Specifically, machine learning is used to develop feasible regions in the parameter space where the admissible target accuracy is achieved with a predefined reduced order basis, to construct parametric maps, to chose the best two already existing bases for a new parameter configuration from accuracy point of view and to pre-select the optimal dimension of the reduced basis such as to meet the desired accuracy. By combining available information using bases concatenation and interpolation as well as high-fidelity solutions interpolation we are able to build accurate reduced order models associated with new parameter settings. Promising numerical results with a viscous Burgers model illustrate the potential of machine learning approaches to help design better reduced order models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Safety-Critical Controller Synthesis with Reduced-Order Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16479v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide lower dimensional representations of complex systems, capturing their salient features while simplifying control design. Building on previous work, this paper presents an overarching framework for the integration of ROMs and control barrier functions, enabling the use of simplified models to construct safety-critical controllers while providing safety guarantees for complex full-order models. To achieve this, we formalize the connection between full and ROMs by defining projection mappings that relate the states and inputs of these models and leverage simulation functions to establish conditions under which safety guarantees may be transferred from a ROM to its corresponding full-order model. The efficacy of our framework is illustrated through simulation results on a drone and hardware demonstrations on ARCHER, a 3D hopping robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[A segregated reduced order model of a pressure-based solver for turbulent compressible flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09396v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article provides a reduced-order modelling framework for turbulent compressible flows discretized by the use of finite volume approaches. The basic idea behind this work is the construction of a reduced-order model capable of providing closely accurate solutions with respect to the high fidelity flow fields. Full-order solutions are often obtained through the use of segregated solvers (solution variables are solved one after another), employing slightly modified conservation laws so that they can be decoupled and then solved one at a time. Classical reduction architectures, on the contrary, rely on the Galerkin projection of a complete Navier-Stokes system to be projected all at once, causing a mild discrepancy with the high order solutions. This article relies on segregated reduced-order algorithms for the resolution of turbulent and compressible flows in the context of physical and geometrical parameters. At the full-order level turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity approach. Since there is a variety of different turbulence models for the approximation of this supplementary viscosity, one of the aims of this work is to provide a reduced-order model which is independent on this selection. This goal is reached by the application of hybrid methods where Navier-Stokes equations are projected in a standard way while the viscosity field is approximated by the use of data-driven interpolation methods or by the evaluation of a properly trained neural network. By exploiting the aforementioned expedients it is possible to predict accurate solutions with respect to the full-order problems characterized by high Reynolds numbers and elevated Mach numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Reduced Order Modelling and Efficient Temporal Evolution of Fluid Simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04556v1)** | 2021-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) has been widely used to create lower order, computationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems. Using these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using significantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly projecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep Learning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of non-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced state to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D Autoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to create highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to efficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned reduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or needing to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby resulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and performance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance and computational runtime metrics. DL-ROM can reduce the computational runtimes of iterative solvers by nearly two orders of magnitude while maintaining an acceptable error threshold.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Reduced Order Modeling with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10930v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced Order Modeling is of paramount importance for efficiently inferring high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields in parametric contexts, enabling computationally tractable parametric analyses, uncertainty quantification and control. However, conventional dimensionality reduction techniques are typically limited to known and constant parameters, inefficient for nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and uninformed to the actual system behavior. In this work, we propose sensor-driven SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks for Reduced Order Modeling (SHRED-ROM). Specifically, we consider the composition of a long short-term memory network, which encodes the temporal dynamics of limited sensor data in multiple scenarios, and a shallow decoder, which reconstructs the corresponding high-dimensional states. SHRED-ROM is a robust decoding-only strategy that circumvents the numerically unstable approximation of an inverse which is required by encoding-decoding schemes. To enhance computational efficiency and memory usage, the full-order state snapshots are reduced by, e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition, allowing for compressive training of the networks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. Through applications on chaotic and nonlinear fluid dynamics, we show that SHRED-ROM (i) accurately reconstructs the state dynamics for new parameter values starting from limited fixed or mobile sensors, independently on sensor placement, (ii) can cope with both physical, geometrical and time-dependent parametric dependencies, while being agnostic to their actual values, (iii) can accurately estimate unknown parameters, and (iv) can deal with different data sources, such as high-fidelity simulations, coupled fields and videos.</p></details> |  |

A dynamic logic is a first-order modal logic with a pair of parametrized modal operators for each dynamical system to express necessary or possible properties of their transition behavior. Due to their full basis of first-order modal logic operators, dynamic logics can express a rich variety of system properties, including safety, controllability, reactivity, liveness, and quantified parametrized properties, even about relations between multiple dynamical systems. In this survey, we focus on some of the representatives of the family of differential dynamic logics, which share the ability to express properties of dynamical systems having continuous dynamics described by various forms of differential equations. We explain the dynamical system models, dynamic logics of dynamical systems, their semantics, their axiomatizations, and proof calculi for proving logical formulas about these dynamical systems. We study differential invariants, i.e., induction principles for differential equations. We survey theoretical results, including soundness and completeness and deductive power. Differential dynamic logics have been implemented in automatic and interactive theorem provers and have been used successfully to verify safety-critical applications in automotive, aviation, railway, robotics, and analogue electrical circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Long ...</summary><p>Long version of LICS'12 invited tutorial DOI 10.1109/LICS.2012.13</p></details> |

Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and 'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems) cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt. More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and 'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>46+14...</summary><p>46+14 pages, 6 figures; accepted to FOCS 2024</p></details> |

We develop a method for learning to correspond pairs of dynamical systems via a learned latent dynamical system. Given trajectory data from two dynamical systems, we learn a shared latent state space and a shared latent dynamics model, along with an encoder-decoder pair for each of the original systems. With the learned correspondences in place, we can use a simulation of one system to produce an imagined motion of its counterpart. We can also simulate in the learned latent dynamics and synthesize the motions of both corresponding systems, as a form of bisimulation. We demonstrate the approach using pairs of controlled bipedal walkers, as well as by pairing a walker with a controlled pendulum.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph Switching Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00370v1)** | 2023-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems with complex behaviours, e.g. immune system cells interacting with a pathogen, are commonly modelled by splitting the behaviour into different regimes, or modes, each with simpler dynamics, and then learning the switching behaviour from one mode to another. Switching Dynamical Systems (SDS) are a powerful tool that automatically discovers these modes and mode-switching behaviour from time series data. While effective, these methods focus on independent objects, where the modes of one object are independent of the modes of the other objects. In this paper, we focus on the more general interacting object setting for switching dynamical systems, where the per-object dynamics also depends on an unknown and dynamically changing subset of other objects and their modes. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based approach for switching dynamical systems, GRAph Switching dynamical Systems (GRASS), in which we use a dynamic graph to characterize interactions between objects and learn both intra-object and inter-object mode-switching behaviour. We introduce two new datasets for this setting, a synthesized ODE-driven particles dataset and a real-world Salsa Couple Dancing dataset. Experiments show that GRASS can consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2023 |

Furthermore, it contains a sharp upper bound on the number of systems in terms of the dependencies among the coordinate functions. This upper bound generalizes an upper bound for sequential dynamical systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Koopman Representations of Dynamic Systems with Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02233v1)** | 2019-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design and analysis of optimal control policies for dynamical systems can be complicated by nonlinear dependence in the state variables. Koopman operators have been used to simplify the analysis of dynamical systems by mapping the flow of the system onto a space of observables where the dynamics are linear (and possibly infinte). This paper focuses on the development of consistent Koopman representations for controlled dynamical system. We introduce the concept of dynamical consistency for Koopman representations and analyze several existing and proposed representations deriving necessary constraints on the dynamical system, observables, and Koopman operators. Our main result is a hybrid formulation which independently and jointly observes the state and control inputs. This formulation admits a relatively large space of dynamical systems compared to earlier formulations while keeping the Koopman operator independent of the state and control inputs. More generally, this work provides an analysis framework to evaluate and rank proposed simplifications to the general Koopman representation for controlled dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

But the brain is a dynamical system, more like a Watt governor than a Turing machine. Can a dynamical system be said to operate using "representations"? This paper argues that it can, although not in the way a digital computer does. Instead, it uses phenomena best described using mathematic concepts such as chaotic attractors to stand in for aspects of the world.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Causal Modeling of Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08784v4)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems are widely used in science and engineering to model systems consisting of several interacting components. Often, they can be given a causal interpretation in the sense that they not only model the evolution of the states of the system's components over time, but also describe how their evolution is affected by external interventions on the system that perturb the dynamics. We introduce the formal framework of structural dynamical causal models (SDCMs) that explicates the causal semantics of the system's components as part of the model. SDCMs represent a dynamical system as a collection of stochastic processes and specify the basic causal mechanisms that govern the dynamics of each component as a structured system of random differential equations of arbitrary order. SDCMs extend the versatile causal modeling framework of structural causal models (SCMs), also known as structural equation models (SEMs), by explicitly allowing for time-dependence. An SDCM can be thought of as the stochastic-process version of an SCM, where the static random variables of the SCM are replaced by dynamic stochastic processes and their derivatives. We provide the foundations for a theory of SDCMs, by (i) formally defining SDCMs, their solutions, stochastic interventions, and a graphical representation; (ii) studying existence and uniqueness of the solutions for given initial conditions; (iii) providing Markov properties for SDCMs with initial conditions; (iv) discussing under which conditions SDCMs equilibrate to SCMs as time tends to infinity; (v) relating the properties of the SDCM to those of the equilibrium SCM. This correspondence enables one to leverage the wealth of statistical tools and discovery methods available for SCMs when studying the causal semantics of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems. The theory is illustrated with examples from different scientific domains.</p></details> | 54 pages |
| **[Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09352v1)** | 2024-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability guarantees are crucial when ensuring a fully autonomous robot does not take undesirable or potentially harmful actions. Unfortunately, global stability guarantees are hard to provide in dynamical systems learned from data, especially when the learned dynamics are governed by neural networks. We propose a novel methodology to learn neural contractive dynamical systems, where our neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability. To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, we develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive stability after decoding. We further extend our approach to learning contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations to account for full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The result is the first highly flexible learning architecture that provides contractive stability guarantees with capability to perform obstacle avoidance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach encodes the desired dynamics more accurately than the current state-of-the-art, which provides less strong stability guarantees.</p></details> |  |

The objective of this paper is to learn a neural dynamical model that approximates this system, while preserving the dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this work, we address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model in two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a neural dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.</p></details> | 6 pages |

| **[Safely Learning Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12284v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in learning an unknown dynamical system is to reduce model uncertainty by making measurements while maintaining safety. We formulate a mathematical definition of what it means to safely learn a dynamical system by sequentially deciding where to initialize trajectories. The state of the system must stay within a safety region for a horizon of $T$ time steps under the action of all dynamical systems that (i) belong to a given initial uncertainty set, and (ii) are consistent with information gathered so far. First, we consider safely learning a linear dynamical system involving $n$ states. For the case $T=1$, we present an LP-based algorithm that either safely recovers the true dynamics from at most $n$ trajectories, or certifies that safe learning is impossible. For $T=2$, we give an SDP representation of the set of safe initial conditions and show that $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ trajectories generically suffice for safe learning. For $T = \infty$, we provide SDP-representable inner approximations of the set of safe initial conditions and show that one trajectory generically suffices for safe learning. We extend a number of our results to the cases where the initial uncertainty set contains sparse, low-rank, or permutation matrices, or when the system has a control input. Second, we consider safely learning a general class of nonlinear dynamical systems. For the case $T=1$, we give an SOCP-based representation of the set of safe initial conditions. For $T=\infty$, we provide semidefinite representable inner approximations to the set of safe initial conditions. We show how one can safely collect trajectories and fit a polynomial model of the nonlinear dynamics that is consistent with the initial uncertainty set and best agrees with the observations. We also present some extensions to cases where the measurements are noisy or the dynamical system involves disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.12257</p></details> |

Most existing approaches are limited to learning within a single system with fixed dynamics patterns. However, many real-world applications require learning across systems with evolving dynamics patterns, a challenge that has been largely overlooked. To address this, we systematically investigate the problem of Continual Dynamics Learning (CDL), examining task configurations and evaluating the applicability of existing techniques, while identifying key challenges. In response, we propose the Mode-switching Graph ODE (MS-GODE) model, which integrates the strengths LG-ODE and sub-network learning with a mode-switching module, enabling efficient learning over varying dynamics. Moreover, we construct a novel benchmark of biological dynamic systems for CDL, Bio-CDL, featuring diverse systems with disparate dynamics and significantly enriching the research field of machine learning for dynamic systems.

In this work, we study the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems, taking an initial step toward extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable models. We first prove the identifiability of Markov Switching Models, which commonly serve as the prior distribution for the continuous latent variables in Switching Dynamical Systems. We present identification conditions for first-order Markov dependency structures, whose transition distribution is parametrised via non-linear Gaussians. We then establish the identifiability of the latent variables and non-linear mappings in Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations, by leveraging identifiability analysis techniques from identifiable deep latent variable models. We finally develop estimation algorithms for identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems. Throughout empirical studies, we demonstrate the practicality of identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems for segmenting high-dimensional time series such as videos, and showcase the use of identifiable Markov Switching Models for regime-dependent causal discovery in climate data.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
