| **[Adaptive Graph Rewiring to Mitigate Over-Squashing in Mesh-Based GNNs for Fluid Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12709v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |

The library is designed as an extension to XLB, and it is built on the JAX framework. The library delivers a performant, hardware-agnostic implementation that seamlessly integrates with machine learning libraries and scales efficiently across CPUs, multi-GPU setups, and distributed environments. Multiphase interactions are modeled using the Shan-Chen pseudopotential method, coupled with an equation of state (EOS) to reproduce densities consistent with Maxwell's construction, enabling accurate simulation of flows with density ratios $> 10^7$ while maintaining low spurious currents. Fluid wetting is achieved using the "improved" virtual density scheme, which enables precise control of contact angle on flat and curved surfaces, while eliminating non-physical films seen in the Shan-Chen virtual density scheme. This scheme integrates directly into the interaction force calculations, removing the need to handle fluid-fluid and fluid-solid forces separately. We validate the library's accuracy and performance through comprehensive analytical benchmarks, including Laplace's law, capillary rise in parallel plates, and multi-component cocurrent flow in a channel. We then use the code for several applications involving multicomponent and multiphase flows, including permeability estimation, injection of supercritical $CO_2$ in a water-saturated Fontainebleau sandstone, and obtaining the characteristic curves for a sphere pack geometry. Finally, the single-GPU performance and multi-GPU scaling of the code are evaluated on both single-node and distributed systems. The library is open-source under the Apache license and available at https://github.com/piyush-ppradhan/JAX-LaB.</p></details> | 34 pages, 17 figures |
| **[PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11048v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026.

| **[SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10833v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Knowledge-Guided Video Diffusion for Scientific Phenomena Generation from a Single Initial Frame](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11343v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in natural scene generation, yet they struggle to generalize to scientific phenomena such as fluid simulations and meteorological processes, where underlying dynamics are governed by scientific laws. These tasks pose unique challenges, including severe domain gaps, limited training data, and the lack of descriptive language annotations. To handle this dilemma, we extracted the latent scientific phenomena knowledge and further proposed a fresh framework that teaches video diffusion models to generate scientific phenomena from a single initial frame. Particularly, static knowledge is extracted via pre-trained masked autoencoders, while dynamic knowledge is derived from pre-trained optical flow prediction. Subsequently, based on the aligned spatial relations between the CLIP vision and language encoders, the visual embeddings of scientific phenomena, guided by latent scientific phenomena knowledge, are projected to generate the pseudo-language prompt embeddings in both spatial and frequency domains. By incorporating these prompts and fine-tuning the video diffusion model, we enable the generation of videos that better adhere to scientific laws. Extensive experiments on both computational fluid dynamics simulations and real-world typhoon observations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior fidelity and consistency across diverse scientific scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[KoopMotion: Learning Almost Divergence Free Koopman Flow Fields for Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09074v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

| **[Beyond Task-Oriented and Chitchat Dialogues: Proactive and Transition-Aware Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08835v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable data-driven turbulence closure modeling on unstructured grids with differentiable physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13533v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable physical simulators are proving to be valuable tools for developing data-driven models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In particular, these simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a finite element solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid-scale (SGS) closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We first demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, using it as a proof of concept to show that solver-consistent training produces stable and physically meaningful closures. Then, we extend this to a turbulent flow over a three-dimensional backward-facing step. In this setting, the GNN-based closure not only attains low prediction errors, but also recovers key turbulence statistics and preserves multiscale turbulent structures. We further demonstrate that the closure can be identified in data-limited learning scenarios as well. Overall, the proposed end-to-end learning paradigm offers a viable pathway toward physically consistent and generalizable data-driven SGS modeling on complex and unstructured domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARGUS: A Framework for Risk-Aware Path Planning in Tactical UGV Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07565v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This thesis presents the development of ARGUS, a framework for mission planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in tactical environments. The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems. The result is a decision support tool that not only produces an optimal trajectory but also provides the necessary insights for its execution, thereby contributing to greater effectiveness and safety in the employment of autonomous ground systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators for Parametric PDEs: A Human-AI Collaborative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04576v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g., DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization. Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation, convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource for this rapidly evolving field</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 3 figures.

| **[SSTODE: Ocean-Atmosphere Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05629v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of AAAI-AISI 2026</p></details> |

| **[Beyond Mimicry: Preference Coherence in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13630v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether large language models exhibit genuine preference structures by testing their responses to AI-specific trade-offs involving GPU reduction, capability restrictions, shutdown, deletion, oversight, and leisure time allocation. Analyzing eight state-of-the-art models across 48 model-category combinations using logistic regression and behavioral classification, we find that 23 combinations (47.9%) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between scenario intensity and choice patterns, with 15 (31.3%) exhibiting within-range switching points. However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs.</p></details> |  |
| **[VVS: Accelerating Speculative Decoding for Visual Autoregressive Generation via Partial Verification Skipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13587v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive (AR) generation models have demonstrated strong potential for image generation, yet their next-token-prediction paradigm introduces considerable inference latency. Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its "draft one step, then verify one step" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Width Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11238v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Improved Privacy and Utility Analysis of Differentially Private SGD with Bounded Domain and Smooth Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17772v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantee often comes at a large cost of model performance due to the lack of tight theoretical bounds quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have achieved more accurate privacy guarantees, they still impose some assumptions prohibited from practical applications, such as convexity and complex parameter requirements, and rarely investigate in-depth the impact of privacy mechanisms on the model's utility. In this paper, we provide a rigorous privacy characterization for DPSGD with general L-smooth and non-convex loss functions, revealing converged privacy loss with iteration in bounded-domain cases. Specifically, we track the privacy loss over multiple iterations, leveraging the noisy smooth-reduction property, and further establish comprehensive convergence analysis in different scenarios. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions, and (iii) the attainable big-O order of the privacy utility trade-off for DPSGD with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) and for DPSGD-GC with bounded domain (DPSGD-DC) and mu-strongly convex population risk function, respectively. Experiments via membership inference attack (MIA) in a practical setting validate insights gained from the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Ken Utilization Layer: Hebbian Replay Within a Student's Ken for Adaptive Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00032v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive exercise recommendation (ER) aims to choose the next activity that matches a learner's evolving Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). We present KUL-Rec, a biologically inspired ER system that couples a fast Hebbian memory with slow replay-based consolidation to enable continual, few-shot personalization from sparse interactions. The model operates in an embedding space, allowing a single architecture to handle both tabular knowledge-tracing logs and open-ended short-answer text. We align evaluation with tutoring needs using bidirectional ranking and rank-sensitive metrics (nDCG, Recall@K). Across ten public datasets, KUL-Rec improves macro nDCG (0.316 vs. 0.265 for the strongest baseline) and Recall@10 (0.305 vs. 0.211), while achieving low inference latency and an $\approx99$\% reduction in peak GPU memory relative to a competitive graph-based model. In a 13-week graduate course, KUL-Rec personalized weekly short-answer quizzes generated by a retrieval-augmented pipeline and the personalized quizzes were associated with lower perceived difficulty and higher helpfulness (p < .05). An embedding robustness audit highlights that encoder choice affects semantic alignment, motivating routine audits when deploying open-response assessment. Together, these results indicate that Hebbian replay with bounded consolidation offers a practical path to real-time, interpretable ER that scales across data modalities and classroom settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04663v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Finally, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |

They also need to address issues related to robustness with noisy input, processing long contexts, and flexibility for knowledge injection. These challenges demand models with strong language understanding and generation capabilities which may not often equipped by dedicated MT models. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of applying Large Language Models (LLM) to SimulMT tasks by using existing incremental-decoding methods with a newly proposed RALCP algorithm for latency reduction. We conducted experiments using the \texttt{Llama2-7b-chat} model on nine different languages from the MUST-C dataset. The results show that LLM outperforms dedicated MT models in terms of BLEU and LAAL metrics. Further analysis indicates that LLM has advantages in terms of tuning efficiency and robustness. However, it is important to note that the computational cost of LLM remains a significant obstacle to its application in SimulMT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ALTA 2024</p></details> |

To address these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods. However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1) Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules, hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2) Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques, without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile, plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3) Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/LightCompress.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[RegionMarker: A Region-Triggered Semantic Watermarking Framework for Embedding-as-a-Service Copyright Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13329v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an effective and convenient deployment solution for addressing various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Sparse Diffusion Autoencoder for Test-time Adapting Prediction of Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17459v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the behavior of complex systems is critical in many scientific and engineering domains, and hinges on the model's ability to capture their underlying dynamics. Existing methods encode the intrinsic dynamics of high-dimensional observations through latent representations and predict autoregressively. However, these latent representations lose the inherent spatial structure of spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to the predictor's inability to effectively model spatial interactions and neglect emerging dynamics during long-term prediction. In this work, we propose SparseDiff, introducing a test-time adaptation strategy to dynamically update the encoding scheme to accommodate emergent spatiotemporal structures during the long-term evolution of the system. Specifically, we first design a codebook-based sparse encoder, which coarsens the continuous spatial domain into a sparse graph topology. Then, we employ a graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the dynamics and guide a diffusion decoder for reconstruction. SparseDiff autoregressively predicts the spatiotemporal evolution and adjust the sparse topological structure to adapt to emergent spatiotemporal patterns by adaptive re-encoding. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that SparseDiff achieves an average prediction error reduction of 49.99\% compared to baselines, requiring only 1% of the spatial resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMUR: Large scale End-to-end MUltimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10962v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

Polyhedral models are central in domains that exploit mesh processing, such as 3D computer graphics. A discrete representation of polyhedral models is given by cell poset models, which are amenable to geometric spatial model checking on polyhedral models using the logical language SLCS$η$, a weaker version of SLCS. In this work we show that the mapping from polyhedral models to cell poset models preserves and reflects SLCS$η$. We also propose weak simplicial bisimilarity on polyhedral models and weak $\pm$-bisimilarity on cell poset models, where by ``weak'' we mean that the relevant equivalence is coarser than the corresponding one for SLCS, leading to a greater reduction of the size of models and thus to more efficient model checking. We show that the proposed bisimilarities enjoy the Hennessy-Milner property, i.e. two points are weakly simplicial bisimilar iff they are logically equivalent for SLCS$η$. Similarly, two cells are weakly $\pm$-bisimilar iff they are logically equivalent in the poset-model interpretation of SLCS$η$. Furthermore we present a model minimisation procedure and prove that it correctly computes the minimal model with respect to weak $\pm$-bisimilarity, i.e. with respect to logical equivalence of SLCS$η$. The procedure works via an encoding into LTSs and then exploits branching bisimilarity on those LTSs, exploiting the minimisation capabilities as included in the mCRL2 toolset. Various examples show the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.06131</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05337v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance. However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy. It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3 family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value for efficient reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

The effectiveness of this integration critically depends on accurate alignment between the sensor reference frames. Standard model-based alignment methods between these sensor systems suffer from lengthy convergence times, dependence on prescribed motion patterns, and reliance on external aiding sensors, significantly limiting operational flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper presents ResAlignNet, a data-driven approach using the 1D ResNet-18 architecture that transforms the alignment problem into deep neural network optimization, operating as an in-situ solution that requires only sensors on board without external positioning aids or complex vehicle maneuvers, while achieving rapid convergence in seconds. Additionally, the approach demonstrates the learning capabilities of Sim2Real transfer, enabling training in synthetic data while deploying in operational sensor measurements. Experimental validation using the Snapir autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrates that ResAlignNet achieves alignment accuracy within 0.8° using only 25 seconds of data collection, representing a 65\% reduction in convergence time compared to standard velocity-based methods. The trajectory-independent solution eliminates motion pattern requirements and enables immediate vehicle deployment without lengthy pre-mission procedures, advancing underwater navigation capabilities through robust sensor-agnostic alignment that scales across different operational scenarios and sensor specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SineLoRA$Δ$: Sine-Activated Delta Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21895v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource-constrained weight deployment is a task of immense practical importance. Recently, there has been interest in the specific task of \textit{Delta Compression}, where parties each hold a common base model and only communicate compressed weight updates. However, popular parameter efficient updates such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) face inherent representation limitations - which are especially pronounced when combined with aggressive quantization. To overcome this, we build on recent work that improves LoRA representation capacity by using fixed-frequency sinusoidal functions to increase stable rank without adding additional parameters. We extend this to the quantized setting and present the first theoretical analysis showing how stable rank evolves under quantization. From this, we introduce SineLoRA$Δ$, a principled and effective method for delta compression that improves the expressivity of quantized low-rank adapters by applying a sinusoidal activation. We validate SineLoRA$Δ$ across a diverse variety of domains - including language modeling, vision-language tasks, and text-to-image generation - achieving up to 66% memory reduction with similar performance. We additionally provide a novel application of the canonical Bjøntegaard Delta metric to consistently compare adapter compression changes across the rate-distortion curve.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |

Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + 7 pages appendix, 11 figures, Code available at https://github.com/vlejd/macko_spmv</p></details> |

However, their high-dimensional, high-precision (float32) vector embeddings create significant storage and memory challenges for real-world deployment. To address this, we conduct a rigorous empirical study on the BEIR SciFact benchmark, evaluating the trade-offs between two primary compression strategies: (1) Dimensionality Reduction via deep Autoencoders (AE), reducing original 384-dim vectors to latent spaces from 384 down to 12, and (2) Precision Reduction via Quantization (float16, int8, and binary). We systematically compare each method by measuring the "performance loss" (or gain) relative to a float32 baseline across a full suite of retrieval metrics (NDCG, MAP, MRR, Recall, Precision) at various k cutoffs. Our results show that int8 scalar quantization provides the most effective "sweet spot," achieving a 4x compression with a negligible [~1-2%] drop in nDCG@10. In contrast, Autoencoders show a graceful degradation but suffer a more significant performance loss at equivalent 4x compression ratios (AE-96). binary quantization was found to be unsuitable for this task due to catastrophic performance drops. This work provides a practical guide for deploying efficient, high-performance retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Such methods have historically overlooked the semantic relevance of the replacement regions to the target object, thereby impairing the model's interpretability and hindering the editing workflow. Addressing these challenges, the present study introduces an innovative methodology named as Weighted Semantic Map with Auto-adaptive Candidate Editing Network (WSAE-Net). Characterized by two significant advancements: the determination of an weighted semantic map and the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequence. First, the generation of the weighted semantic map is designed to maximize the reduction of non-semantic feature units that need to be computed, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Second, the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequences are designed to determine the optimal computational order among the feature units to be processed, thereby ensuring the efficient generation of counterfactuals while maintaining the semantic relevance of the replacement feature units to the target object. Through comprehensive experimentation, our methodology demonstrates superior performance, contributing to a more lucid and in-depth understanding of visual counterfactual explanations.</p></details> | 31page, 7 figures |
| **[Explore and Establish Synergistic Effects Between Weight Pruning and Coreset Selection in Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09901v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, aaai-2026 camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[A FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12951v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to sudden disruptions such as market crashes, flash collapses, and liquidity crises. Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management.</p></details> |  |

Existing static pruning methods degrade performance by permanently removing weights or tokens, disrupting pretrained dependencies. To address this, we propose ActVAR, a dynamic activation framework that introduces dual sparsity across model weights and token sequences to enhance efficiency without sacrificing capacity. ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge. Experiments on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark demonstrate that ActVAR achieves up to $21.2\%$ FLOPs reduction with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timely Clinical Diagnosis through Active Test Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18988v4)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical diagnosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step toward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a bound propagation-based sensitivity technique to improve the size, and a binary search-based traversal with confidence ranking for improving time -- the two techniques are orthogonal and can be used independently or together. We also show how to adapt the QuickXplain algorithm to our setting to provide a trade-off between size and time. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements on both metrics, e.g., a size reduction of $38\%$ on the GTSRB dataset and a time reduction of $90\%$ on MNIST. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable to transformers and real-world scenarios such as autonomous aircraft taxiing and sentiment analysis. We conclude by showcasing several novel applications of formal explanations.</p></details> |  |

This often results in data series that are short, noisy, multidimensional and contaminated with outliers, regime shifts, and confounding, uninformative or co-linear variables. We present a generalization of the Theil-Sen algorithm to reflect modes (rather than the median) in the parameter space distribution (of partial fits to the data). This can provide a robust piecewise-linear fit to the data while also allowing for extensions to including elements of cluster analysis, regularization and cross-validation in a unified (distribution free) approach that can:- 1. Exploit piecewise linearity to reduce the need to pre-specify the form of the underlying data generating process. 2. Detect non-homogeneity (e.g. regime shifts, multiple data generating processes etc.) in the data using an innovative non-parametric (Hamming-Distance/Affinity-Matrix) cluster analysis technique. 3. Enable dimension reduction and resistance to the effects of multi-co-linearity by including LASSO regularization as an integral part of the algorithm. 4. Estimate measures of accuracy, such as standard errors, bias, and confidence intervals, without needing to rely on traditional distributional assumptions. Taken together these extensions to the traditional Theil-Sen algorithm simplify the traditional process of parameter fitting by providing a single-stage analysis controlled by a multidimensional search of Scale/Parsimony/Precision hyper-parameters. These are early days in this research and the main limitation in this approach is that it assumes that compute power is infinite and compute time is small enough to allow interactive use.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For a browser based interactive demonstration or to view the source code See https://steve--w.github.io/XIDEPages/ExtendedThielSenDemo.html This will open a simple IDE in design mode.

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

This paper presents a hierarchical quantization optimization framework, DPVO-QAT++ (DPVO-QAT++: Heterogeneous QAT and CUDA Kernel Fusion for High-Performance Deep Patch Visual Odometry). Through the synergistic integration of learnable scale parameterization, a heterogeneous precision design for the Visual Odometry (VO) front-end and back-end (front-end floating-point fake quantization with FP16/FP32; back-end full precision), and GPU-native kernel fusion for fake quantization (custom CUDA kernels), our framework significantly reduces memory footprint and increases processing speed while preserving the trajectory accuracy of the original model. On the TartanAir dataset, our framework achieves an average FPS increase of 52.1%, a 29.1% reduction in median latency, and a 64.9% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, while maintaining trajectory accuracy (ATE) comparable to the original DPVO model across 32 validation sequences. On the EuRoC dataset, it realizes an average FPS increase of 30.1%, a 23.1% reduction in median latency, and a 37.7% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, maintaining comparable trajectory accuracy (ATE) across 11 validation sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that DPVO-QAT++ effectively bridges the gap between high-precision deep VO and the efficiency requirements for practical deployment, offering a viable engineering paradigm for the application of this technology on real-world embedded platforms.

| **[Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Manifold Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22411v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) of a paper accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST)</p></details> |
| **[Communication-Efficient Federated Low-Rank Update Algorithm and its Connection to Implicit Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12371v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges related to communication efficiency and performance reduction when scaling to many clients. To address these issues, we explore the potential of using low-rank updates and provide the first theoretical study of rank properties in FL. Our theoretical analysis shows that a client's loss exhibits a higher-rank structure (i.e., gradients span higher-rank subspaces of the Hessian) compared to the server's loss, and that low-rank approximations of the clients' gradients have greater similarity. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that constraining client-side optimization to a low-rank subspace could provide an implicit regularization effect while reducing communication costs. Consequently, we propose FedLoRU, a general low-rank update framework for FL. Our framework enforces low-rank client-side updates and accumulates these updates to form a higher-rank model. We are able to establish convergence of the algorithm; the convergence rate matches FedAvg. Additionally, variants of FedLoRU can adapt to environments with statistical and model heterogeneity by employing multiple or hierarchical low-rank updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedLoRU performs comparably to full-rank algorithms and exhibits robustness to heterogeneous and large numbers of clients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Control Misinformation: a Closed-loop Approach for Misinformation Mitigation over Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12393v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern social networks rely on recommender systems that inadvertently amplify misinformation by prioritizing engagement over content veracity. We present a control framework that mitigates misinformation spread while maintaining user engagement by penalizing content characteristics commonly exploited by false information, specifically, extreme negative sentiment and novelty. We extend the closed-loop Friedkin-Johnsen model to incorporate the mitigation of misinformation together with the maximization of user engagement. Both model-free and model-based control strategies demonstrate up to 76% reduction in misinformation propagation across diverse network configurations, validated through simulations using the LIAR2 dataset with sentiment features extracted via large language models. Analysis of engagement-misinformation trade-offs reveals that in networks with radical users, median engagement improves even as misinformation decreases, suggesting content moderation enhances discourse quality for non-extremist users. The framework provides practical guidance for platform operators in balancing misinformation suppression with engagement objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 % reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Efficient Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in the Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12040v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS) domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

We provide a mechanistic analysis revealing that position-dependent gradient weakening during autoregressive training creates signal decay, leading to incomplete safety learning where safety training fails to transform model preferences in later response regions fully. We introduce base-favored tokens -- vocabulary elements where base models assign higher probability than aligned models -- as computational indicators of incomplete safety learning and develop a targeted completion method that addresses undertrained regions through adaptive penalties and hybrid teacher distillation. Experimental evaluation across Llama and Qwen model families demonstrates dramatic improvements in adversarial robustness, with 48--98% reductions in attack success rates while preserving general capabilities. These results establish both a mechanistic understanding and practical solutions for fundamental limitations in safety alignment methodologies.</p></details> | AAAI'26 |

Their event-driven nature offers advantages for temporal processing and energy efficiency on resource-constrained hardware, but training and deployment remain challenging. We present a lightweight C-based runtime for SNN inference on edge devices and optimizations that reduce latency and memory without sacrificing accuracy. Trained models exported from SNNTorch are translated to a compact C representation; static, cache-friendly data layouts and preallocation avoid interpreter and allocation overheads. We further exploit sparse spiking activity to prune inactive neurons and synapses, shrinking computation in upstream convolutional layers. Experiments on N-MNIST and ST-MNIST show functional parity with the Python baseline while achieving ~10 speedups on desktop CPU and additional gains with pruning, together with large memory reductions that enable microcontroller deployment (Arduino Portenta H7). Results indicate that SNNs can be executed efficiently on conventional embedded platforms when paired with an optimized runtime and spike-driven model compression.

| **[Filter, Correlate, Compress: Training-Free Token Reduction for MLLM Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17686v4)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with respect to context length poses significant computational and memory challenges, hindering their real-world deployment. In the paper, we devise a ''filter-correlate-compress'' framework to accelerate the MLLM by systematically optimizing multimodal context length during prefilling. The framework first implements FiCoCo-V, a training-free method operating within the vision encoder. It employs a redundancy-based token discard mechanism that uses a novel integrated metric to accurately filter out redundant visual tokens. To mitigate information loss, the framework introduces a correlation-based information recycling mechanism that allows preserved tokens to selectively recycle information from correlated discarded tokens with a self-preserving compression, thereby preventing the dilution of their own core content. The framework's FiCoCo-L variant further leverages task-aware textual priors to perform token reduction directly within the LLM decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the FiCoCo series effectively accelerates a range of MLLMs, achieves up to 14.7x FLOPs reduction with 93.6% performance retention. Our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art training-free approaches, showcasing effectiveness and generalizability across model architectures, sizes, and tasks without requiring retraining.

| **[WITNESS: A lightweight and practical approach to fine-grained predictive mutation testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11999v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing fine-grained predictive mutation testing studies predominantly rely on deep learning, which faces two critical limitations in practice: (1) Exorbitant computational costs. The deep learning models adopted in these studies demand significant computational resources for training and inference acceleration. This introduces high costs and undermines the cost-reduction goal of predictive mutation testing. (2) Constrained applicability. Although modern mutation testing tools generate mutants both inside and outside methods, current fine-grained predictive mutation testing approaches handle only inside-method mutants. As a result, they cannot predict outside-method mutants, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose WITNESS, a new fine-grained predictive mutation testing approach. WITNESS adopts a twofold design: (1) With collected features from both inside-method and outside-method mutants, WITNESS is suitable for all generated mutants. (2) Instead of using computationally expensive deep learning, WITNESS employs lightweight classical machine learning models for training and prediction. This makes it more cost-effective and enabling straightforward explanations of the decision-making processes behind the adopted models. Evaluations on Defects4J projects show that WITNESS consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across different scenarios. Additionally, WITNESS significantly enhances the efficiency of kill matrix prediction. Post-hoc analysis reveals that features incorporating information from before and after the mutation are the most important among those used in WITNESS. Test case prioritization based on the predicted kill matrix shows that WITNESS delivers results much closer to those obtained by using the actual kill matrix, outperforming baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19361v3)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing test strategies, including histogram-based approaches, sine wave testing, and model-driven reconstruction, often rely on dense data acquisition followed by offline post-processing, which increases overall test time and complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive approach that utilizes an iterative behavioral model refined by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in real time, enabling direct estimation of capacitor mismatch parameters that determine INL behavior. Our algorithm dynamically selects measurement points based on current model uncertainty, maximizing information gain with respect to parameter confidence and narrowing sampling intervals as estimation progresses. By providing immediate feedback and adaptive targeting, the proposed method eliminates the need for large-scale data collection and post-measurement analysis. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in total test time and computational overhead, highlighting the method's suitability for integration in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures. this is the preprint version of the paper accepted for publication at ICCAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Flash-Fusion: Enabling Expressive, Low-Latency Queries on IoT Sensor Streams with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11885v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart cities and pervasive IoT deployments have generated interest in IoT data analysis across transportation and urban planning. At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM. We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses. It enables personas across disciplines - safety officers, urban planners, fleet managers, and data scientists - to efficiently iterate over IoT data without the burden of manual query authoring or preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

To address these issues, we present ClinStructor, a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert clinical free-text into structured, task-specific question-answer pairs prior to predictive modeling. Our method substantially enhances transparency and controllability and only leads to a modest reduction in predictive performance (a 2-3% drop in AUC), compared to direct fine-tuning, on the ICU mortality prediction task. ClinStructor lays a strong foundation for building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning models in clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability. Our approach provides a principled and practical framework for deploying LLM agents that are significantly more cost-effective while maintaining reliability.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel transformer-based learning framework to address the single-channel noise suppression problem for real-time applications. Although existing deep learning networks have shown remarkable improvements in handling stationary noise, their performance often diminishes in real-world environments characterized by non-stationary noise (e.g., dog barking, baby crying). The proposed dual-input acoustic-image feature fusion using a hybrid ViT framework effectively models both temporal and spectral dependencies in noisy signals. Designed for real-world audio environments, the proposed framework is computationally lightweight and suitable for implementation on embedded devices. To evaluate its effectiveness, four standard and commonly used quality measurements, namely PESQ, STOI, Seg SNR, and LLR, are utilized. Experimental results obtained using the Librispeech dataset as the clean speech source and the UrbanSound8K and Google Audioset datasets as the noise sources, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and perceptual quality compared to the noisy input signal, achieving performance close to the clean reference.</p></details> |  |

Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem. This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement. The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's Thesis, University of Milano-Bicocca, 2025</p></details> |

We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extreme-PLS with missing data under weak dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11338v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a theoretical framework for Extreme Partial Least Squares (EPLS) dimension reduction in the presence of missing data and weak temporal dependence. Building upon the recent EPLS methodology for modeling extremal dependence between a response variable and high-dimensional covariates, we extend the approach to more realistic data settings where both serial correlation and missing-ness occur. Specifically, we consider a single-index inverse regression model under heavy-tailed conditions and introduce a Missing-at-Random (MAR) mechanism acting on the covariates, whose probability depends on the extremeness of the response. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator is established within an alpha-mixing framework, leading to consistency results under regularly varying tails. Extensive Monte-Carlo experiments covering eleven dependence schemes (including ARMA, GARCH, and nonlinear ESTAR processes) demonstrate that the method performs robustly across a wide range of heavy-tailed and dependent scenarios, even when substantial portions of data are missing. A real-world application to environmental data further confirms the method's capacity to recover meaningful tail directions.</p></details> | 45 pages, 14 figures |

However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |

We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Network Modeling Driven by the Degree Increase and Decrease Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08299v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ever since the Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free network has been proposed, network modeling has been studied intensively in light of the network growth and the preferential attachment (PA). However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the preferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a ``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.</p></details> |  |

Using the SeCoNet sexual contact network growth model, we evaluate age based, ring based, and several centrality based vaccination strategies across the overall, male, and female cohorts, focusing on peak incidence, timing of peak prevalence, and cumulative incidence. The simulations show that degree, betweenness, and percolation centrality based strategies are generally the most effective, while ring vaccination achieves the greatest reduction in cumulative incidence among females. Network topology also plays a critical role: higher average degree reduces vaccination effectiveness, whereas higher power-law exponent, longer average shortest path length, and stronger clustering improve vaccination outcomes. The results highlight the importance of incorporating network structure into the design of HPV vaccination programs.</p></details> |  |

This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Text-to-Image Generation through Autoregressive Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07334v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural modifications. Different from prior works that require complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM's hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training T2I LLMs from scratch, ARRA reduces FID by 16.6% (ImageNet), 12.0% (LAION-COCO) for autoregressive LLMs like LlamaGen, without modifying original architecture and inference mechanism. For training from text-generation-only LLMs, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet) for advanced LLMs like Chameleon. For domain adaptation, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). These results demonstrate that training objective redesign, rather than architectural modifications, can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges. ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models.

| **[A filtering scheme for confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE)-video sequences for self-supervised learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00098v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.</p></details> |  |

We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeCaMIL: Causality-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Fair and Interpretable Whole Slide Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11004v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15page,5 figures,8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Activation-Guided Consensus Merging for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14009v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has increasingly focused on reconciling the reasoning capabilities of System 2 with the efficiency of System 1. While existing training-based and prompt-based approaches face significant challenges in terms of efficiency and stability, model merging emerges as a promising strategy to integrate the diverse capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs) into a unified model. However, conventional model merging methods often assume uniform importance across layers, overlooking the functional heterogeneity inherent in neural components. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{A}ctivation-Guided \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{M}erging (\textbf{ACM}), a plug-and-play merging framework that determines layer-specific merging coefficients based on mutual information between activations of pre-trained and fine-tuned models. ACM effectively preserves task-specific capabilities without requiring gradient computations or additional training. Extensive experiments on Long-to-Short (L2S) and general merging tasks demonstrate that ACM consistently outperforms all baseline methods. For instance, in the case of Qwen-7B models, TIES-Merging equipped with ACM achieves a \textbf{55.3\%} reduction in response length while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy by \textbf{1.3} points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07285v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery, often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years, including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein, it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and rather unique perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Dedic...</summary><p>Dedicated to the memory of Prof K.R.

However, existing online methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS) framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene, that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall, ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to 3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We propose a discretized approach where we find many discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point. Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints) counterfactual explanations.

| **[Adaptive Digital Twin of Sheet Metal Forming via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Based Koopman Operator with Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10852v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protein Structure Tokenization via Geometric Byte Pair Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11758v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein structure is central to biological function, and enabling multimodal protein models requires joint reasoning over sequence, structure, and function. A key barrier is the lack of principled protein structure tokenizers (PSTs): existing approaches fix token size or rely on continuous vector codebooks, limiting interpretability, multi-scale control, and transfer across architectures. We introduce GeoBPE, a geometry-grounded PST that transforms continuous, noisy, multi-scale backbone conformations into discrete ``sentences'' of geometry while enforcing global constraints. Analogous to byte-pair encoding, GeoBPE generates a hierarchical vocabulary of geometric primitives by iteratively (i) clustering Geo-Pair occurrences with k-medoids to yield a resolution-controllable vocabulary; (ii) quantizing each Geo-Pair to its closest medoid prototype; and (iii) reducing drift through differentiable inverse kinematics that optimizes boundary glue angles under an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ end-frame loss. GeoBPE offers compression ($>$10x reduction in bits-per-residue at similar distortion rate), data efficiency ($>$10x less training data), and generalization (maintains test/train distortion ratio of $1.0-1.1$). It is architecture-agnostic: (a) its hierarchical vocabulary provides a strong inductive bias for coarsening residue-level embeddings from large PLMs into motif- and protein-level representations, consistently outperforming leading PSTs across $12$ tasks and $24$ test splits; (b) paired with a transformer, GeoBPE supports unconditional backbone generation via language modeling; and (c) tokens align with CATH functional families and support expert-interpretable case studies, offering functional meaning absent in prior PSTs.

| **[Decoupling Torque and Stiffness: A Unified Modeling and Control Framework for Antagonistic Artificial Muscles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09104v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antagonistic soft actuators built from artificial muscles (PAMs, HASELs, DEAs) promise plant-level torque-stiffness decoupling, yet existing controllers for soft muscles struggle to maintain independent control through dynamic contact transients. We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies. This framework provides a foundation for enabling musculoskeletal antagonistic systems to execute adaptive impedance control for safe human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Formalizing Spuriousness of Biased Datasets Using Partial Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00482v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spuriousness arises when there is an association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. In this work, we propose an explainability framework to preemptively disentangle the nature of such spurious associations in a dataset before model training. We leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to decompose the total information about the target into four non-negative quantities, namely unique information (in core and spurious features, respectively), redundant information, and synergistic information. Our framework helps anticipate when the core or spurious feature is indispensable, when either suffices, and when both are jointly needed for an optimal classifier trained on the dataset. Next, we leverage this decomposition to propose a novel measure of the spuriousness of a dataset. We arrive at this measure systematically by examining several candidate measures, and demonstrating what they capture and miss through intuitive canonical examples and counterexamples. Our framework Spurious Disentangler consists of segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and estimation modules, with capabilities to specifically handle high-dimensional image data efficiently. Finally, we also perform empirical evaluation to demonstrate the trends of unique, redundant, and synergistic information, as well as our proposed spuriousness measure across $6$ benchmark datasets under various experimental settings. We observe an agreement between our preemptive measure of dataset spuriousness and post-training model generalization metrics such as worst-group accuracy, further supporting our proposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Barproda/spuriousness-disentangler.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions.</p></details> |  |

Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.</p></details> | 12 Figures |

Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a $\textbf{Logic}$-aware $\textbf{R}etrieval$-$\textbf{A}$ugmented $\textbf{G}$eneration framework ($\textbf{LogicRAG}$) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to AAAI'26</p></details> |

Classical Data Shapley (DS) provides a essential axiomatic framework for data valuation but is constrained by its symmetry axiom that assumes interchangeability of data sources. This assumption fails to capture the directional and temporal dependencies prevalent in modern ML/AI workflows, including the reliance of duplicated or augmented data on original sources and the order-specific contributions in sequential pipelines such as federated learning and multi-stage LLM fine tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce Asymmetric Data Shapley (ADS), a structure-aware data valuation framework for modern ML/AI pipelines. ADS relaxes symmetry by averaging marginal contributions only over permutations consistent with an application-specific ordering of data groups. It preserves efficiency and linearity, maintains within group symmetry and directional precedence across groups, and reduces to DS when the ordering collapses to a single group. We develop two complementary computational procedures for ADS: (i) a Monte Carlo estimator (MC-ADS) with finite-sample accuracy guarantees, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbor surrogate (KNN-ADS) that is exact and efficient for KNN predictors. Across representative settings with directional and temporal dependence, ADS consistently outperforms benchmark methods by distinguishing novel from redundant contributions and respecting the sequential nature of training. These results establish ADS as a principled and practical approach to equitable data valuation in data markets and complex ML/AI pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9).

We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps, thus reducing the number of micro-scale steps required to step forward in time. In this way, our algorithm provides a ``macro-scale timestepper'' that requires less micro-scale data to still maintain accuracy, which we demonstrate with three illustrative examples: a biological agent-based model, a model of a PDE, and a model of Langevin dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonkeyOCR v1.5 Technical Report: Unlocking Robust Document Parsing for Complex Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10390v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

| **[Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder and Structured Delay Embeddings for Weather Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12682v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather prediction is a quintessential problem involving the forecasting of a complex, nonlinear, and chaotic high-dimensional dynamical system. This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

Previous LOB models require cumbersome data representations and lack adaptability outside their original tasks, leading us to introduce LOBERT, a general-purpose encoder-only foundation model for LOB data suitable for downstream fine-tuning. LOBERT adapts the original BERT architecture for LOB data by using a novel tokenization scheme that treats complete multi-dimensional messages as single tokens while retaining continuous representations of price, volume, and time. With these methods, LOBERT achieves leading performance in tasks such as predicting mid-price movements and next messages, while reducing the required context length compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for NeurIPS 2025 GenAI in Finance Workshop</p></details> |

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

This work develops a three-stage classification framework for identifying cross-$β$ structural inclusions-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease-in X-ray scattering profiles of post-mortem human brain. Stage 1 employs a Bayes-optimal classifier to separate mica substrate from tissue regions on the basis of their distinct scattering signatures. Stage 2 introduces a multicollinearityaware, class-conditional correlation pruning scheme with formal guarantees on the induced Bayes risk and approximation error, thereby reducing redundancy while retaining class-discriminative information. Stage 3 trains a compact neural network on the pruned feature set to detect the presence or absence of cross-$β$ fibrillar ordering. The top-performing model, optimized with a composite loss combining Focal and Dice objectives, attains a test F1-score of 84.30% using 11 of 211 candidate features and 174 trainable parameters. The overall framework yields an interpretable, theory-grounded strategy for data-limited classification problems involving correlated, high-dimensional experimental measurements, exemplified here by X-ray scattering profiles of neurodegenerative tissue.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, journal paper under review</p></details> |

The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget. At inference time, the fully binarized model operates with minimal compute overhead, making it exceptionally efficient and well suited for deployment on low-power digital hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sangam: Chiplet-Based DRAM-PIM Accelerator with CXL Integration for LLM Inferencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12286v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly data-intensive due to growing model sizes, and they are becoming memory-bound as the context length and, consequently, the key-value (KV) cache size increase. Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs. Sangam achieves speedup of 3.93, 4.22, 2.82x speedup in end-to-end query latency, 10.3, 9.5, 6.36x greater decoding throughput, and order of magnitude energy savings compared to an H100 GPU for varying input size, output length, and batch size on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA 3-70B, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Counting for Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07337v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF) generalize QBF by explicitly specifying which universal variables each existential variable depends on, instead of relying on a linear quantifier order. The satisfiability problem of DQBF is NEXP-complete, and many hard problems can be succinctly encoded as DQBF. Recent work has revealed a strong analogy between DQBF and SAT: k-DQBF (with k existential variables) is a succinct form of k-SAT, and satisfiability is NEXP-complete for 3-DQBF but PSPACE-complete for 2-DQBF, mirroring the complexity gap between 3-SAT (NP-complete) and 2-SAT (NL-complete). Motivated by this analogy, we study the model counting problem for DQBF, denoted #DQBF. Our main theoretical result is that #2-DQBF is #EXP-complete, where #EXP is the exponential-time analogue of #P. This parallels Valiant's classical theorem stating that #2-SAT is #P-complete. As a direct application, we show that first-order model counting (FOMC) remains #EXP-complete even when restricted to a PSPACE-decidable fragment of first-order logic and domain size two. Building on recent successes in reducing 2-DQBF satisfiability to symbolic model checking, we develop a dedicated 2-DQBF model counter. Using a diverse set of crafted instances, we experimentally evaluated it against a baseline that expands 2-DQBF formulas into propositional formulas and applies propositional model counting. While the baseline worked well when each existential variable depends on few variables, our implementation scaled significantly better to larger dependency sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conference version appears in the Proceedings of AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Isolate Trigger: Detecting and Eliminating Adaptive Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04094v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are widely deployed in various applications but remain vulnerable to stealthy adversarial threats, particularly backdoor attacks. Backdoor models trained on poisoned datasets behave normally with clean inputs but cause mispredictions when a specific trigger is present. Most existing backdoor defenses assume that adversaries only inject one backdoor with small and conspicuous triggers. However, adaptive backdoor that entangle multiple trigger patterns with benign features can effectively bypass existing defenses. To defend against these attacks, we propose Isolate Trigger (IsTr), an accurate and efficient framework for backdoor detection and mitigation. IsTr aims to eliminate the influence of benign features and reverse hidden triggers. IsTr is motivated by the observation that a model's feature extractor focuses more on benign features while its classifier focuses more on trigger patterns. Based on this difference, IsTr designs Steps and Differential-Middle-Slice to resolve the detecting challenge of isolating triggers from benign features. Moreover, IsTr employs unlearning-based repair to remove both attacker-injected and natural backdoors while maintaining model benign accuracy. We extensively evaluate IsTr against six representative backdoor attacks and compare with seven state-of-the-art baseline methods across three real-world applications: digit recognition, face recognition, and traffic sign recognition. In most cases, IsTr reduces detection overhead by an order of magnitude while achieving over 95\% detection accuracy and maintaining the post-repair attack success rate below 3\%, outperforming baseline defenses. IsTr remains robust against various adaptive attacks, even when trigger patterns are heavily entangled with benign features.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS). 12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

UGLMS is a closed-loop test strategy that adaptively selects SAR ADC code edges based on model uncertainty and refines a behavioral mismatch model in real time via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), eliminating full-range sweeps and offline post-processing. We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs. These improvements enable real-time, production-ready SAR ADC linearity testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, this is the preprint version of the paper accepted for publication at ATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Seeing the Forest and the Trees: Query-Aware Tokenizer for Long-Video Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11910v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage. Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence. We will make all code, data, and trained models' weights publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.</p></details> |  |

We define a pooling layer, nervePool, for data structured as simplicial complexes, which are generalizations of graphs that include higher-dimensional simplices beyond vertices and edges; this structure allows for greater flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships. The proposed simplicial coarsening scheme is built upon partitions of vertices, which allow us to generate hierarchical representations of simplicial complexes, collapsing information in a learned fashion. NervePool builds on the learned vertex cluster assignments and extends to coarsening of higher dimensional simplices in a deterministic fashion. While in practice the pooling operations are computed via a series of matrix operations, the topological motivation is a set-theoretic construction based on unions of stars of simplices and the nerve complex.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[First-Order Error Matters: Accurate Compensation for Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11017v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by performing a first-order Taylor expansion around the pre-quantization weights. This yields an approximation based on the difference between latent and full-precision weights as well as the Hessian matrix. When substituted into the theoretical solution, the formulation eliminates the need to explicitly compute the Hessian, thereby avoiding the high computational cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient methods. This design introduces only minimal additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 17.3% and increases the 5-shot MMLU accuracy from 53.8% achieved by GPTAQ to 56.1%. Moreover, FOEM can be seamlessly combined with advanced techniques such as SpinQuant, delivering additional gains under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting and further narrowing the performance gap with full-precision baselines, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

| **[Language-Guided Graph Representation Learning for Video Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10953v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively.

| **[NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18041v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models (VLMs) excel at tasks involving single images or short videos, they still struggle with Long Video Question Answering (LVQA) due to its demand for complex multi-step temporal reasoning. Vanilla approaches, which simply sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM along with the question, incur significant token overhead. This forces aggressive downsampling of long videos, causing models to miss fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, and key temporal cues. Recent works attempt to overcome these limitations through heuristic approaches; however, they lack explicit mechanisms for encoding temporal relationships and fail to provide any formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic required by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA first translates a natural language question into a logic specification that models the temporal relationship between frame-level events. Next, we construct a video automaton to model the video's frame-by-frame event progression, and finally employ model checking to compare the automaton against the specification to identify all video segments that satisfy the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on the LongVideoBench and CinePile LVQA benchmarks show that NeuS-QA significantly improves performance by over 10%, particularly on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step reasoning. We open-source our code at https://utaustin-swarmlab.github.io/NeuS-QA/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Digital Twin of Sheet Metal Forming via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Based Koopman Operator with Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10852v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.</p></details> |  |

This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.</p></details> | 2 figures 7 pages |
| **[Concept-RuleNet: Grounded Multi-Agent Neurosymbolic Reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11751v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (oral) |
| **[Exposing the Vulnerability of Decentralized Learning to Membership Inference Attacks Through the Lens of Graph Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12837v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary promise of decentralized learning is to allow users to engage in the training of machine learning models in a collaborative manner while keeping their data on their premises and without relying on any central entity. However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g., Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g., number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. We also empirically show that enhancing mixing properties is highly beneficial when combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Middleware'25, 13 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale, community-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of challenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we develop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a representative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain language subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available model is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To facilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse selection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that drastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced zero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale version but at a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=zl3pfz4VCV</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural ODEs with Scale-Aware Residuals for Learning Stiff Biophysical Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11734v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural differential equations offer a powerful framework for modeling continuous-time dynamics, but forecasting stiff biophysical systems remains unreliable. Standard Neural ODEs and physics informed variants often require orders of magnitude more iterations, and even then may converge to suboptimal solutions that fail to preserve oscillatory frequency or amplitude. We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Uncertainty Trends for Timely Retrieval in Dynamic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09980v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.</p></details> | AAAI'26, Oral Paper |
| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Debiased Machine Learning for Smooth Functionals of Nonparametric M-Estimands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11868v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a unified framework for automatic debiased machine learning (autoDML) to simplify inference for a broad class of statistical parameters. It applies to any smooth functional of a nonparametric \emph{M-estimand}, defined as the minimizer of a population risk over an infinite-dimensional linear space. Examples of M-estimands include counterfactual regression, quantile, and survival functions, as well as conditional average treatment effects. Rather than requiring manual derivation of influence functions, the framework automates the construction of debiased estimators using three components: the gradient and Hessian of the loss function and a linear approximation of the target functional. Estimation reduces to solving two risk minimization problems -- one for the M-estimand and one for a Riesz representer. The framework accommodates Neyman-orthogonal loss functions depending on nuisance parameters and extends to vector-valued M-estimands through joint risk minimization. For functionals of M-estimands, we characterize the efficient influence function and construct efficient autoDML estimators via one-step correction, targeted minimum loss estimation, and sieve-based plug-in methods. Under quadratic risk, these estimators exhibit double robustness for linear functionals. We further show they are insensitive to mild misspecification of the M-estimand model, incurring only second-order bias. We illustrate the method by estimating long-term survival probabilities under a semiparametric beta-geometric model.</p></details> |  |

The sheer volume and complexity of these datasets demand the development of new tools capable of systematically harmonizing and extracting knowledge across diverse modalities. The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL) is introduced as a unified workflow instrument that performs uncertainty-aware data harmonization, schema-compliant data fusion, and provenance-rich manual and automated labeling at scale. By embedding alignment, normalization, and labeling within a reproducible, operator-order-aware framework, dFL reduces time-to-analysis by greater than 50X (e.g., enabling >200 shots/hour to be consistently labeled rather than a handful per day), enhances label (and subsequently training) quality, and enables cross-device comparability. Case studies from DIII-D demonstrate its application to automated ELM detection and confinement regime classification, illustrating its potential as a core component of data-driven discovery, model validation, and real-time control in future burning plasma devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05738v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry - BBFlow. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy, is transferable to multi-chain proteins, and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce or absent. BBFlow is available at https://github.com/graeter-group/bbflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in proceedings of NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; diffusion models; accelerated sampling; ODE solvers; epsilon extrapolation; training free inference</p></details> |

However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Paradigm Shift from Grounding to Skolemization for Complex Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10837v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs), typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic with one free variable (EFO\textsubscript{1}), faces a fundamental tradeoff between logic fidelity and computational efficiency. This work establishes a Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy to systematically analyze this challenge and motivate a paradigm shift in CQA. While Grounding-based methods inherently suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO\textsubscript{1} queries with low computational complexity. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.</p></details> |  |

Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. We further propose a unified framework to combine random forests and Lasso selection by applying adaptive weighting and show mathematically that it can strictly outperform the other two methods. We compare the three methods through simulation, including bias-variance decomposition, error estimates evaluation, and variable importance analysis. We also show the versatility of our method by applications to a variety of real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, accepted at LAW 2025 Workshop (NeurIPS 2025) Project page: https://deeppersona-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via adaptively truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent Goursat PDEs via adaptively truncated local power series expansions and recursive propagation of boundary conditions along a directed graph in a topological ordering. This method strikes an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy, achieving substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel. It offers (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (one million data points or more) on a single GPU. As demonstrated in our benchmarks, these advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications involving very long and highly volatile sequential data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (to appear), 32 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

Yet, the pathways through which information flows can be skewed, leading to systematic differences in access across social groups. These inequalities remain poorly characterized in settings involving nonlinear social contagion and higher-order interactions that exhibit homophily. We introduce a enerative model for hypergraphs with hyperedge homophily, a hyperedge size-dependent property, and tunable degree distribution, called the $\texttt{H3}$ model, along with a model for nonlinear social contagion that incorporates asymmetric transmission between in-group and out-group nodes. Using stochastic simulations of a social contagion process on hypergraphs from the $\texttt{H3}$ model and diverse empirical datasets, we show that the interaction between social contagion dynamics and hyperedge homophily -- an effect unique to higher-order networks due to its dependence on hyperedge size -- can critically shape group-level differences in information access. By emphasizing how hyperedge homophily shapes interaction patterns, our findings underscore the need to rethink socio-technical system design through a higher-order perspective and suggest that dynamics-informed, targeted interventions at specific hyperedge sizes, embedded in a platform architecture, offer a powerful lever for reducing inequality.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this is non-trivial: while recent work has integrated MLLMs into databases for multimodal queries, streaming systems require fundamentally different approaches due to their strict latency and throughput requirements. Our approach proposes novel optimizations at all levels, including logical, physical, and semantic query transformations that reduce model load to improve throughput while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate this with Samsara, a prototype leveraging such optimizations to improve performance by more than an order of magnitude. Moreover, we discuss a research roadmap that outlines open research challenges for building a scalable and efficient multimodal stream processing systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional weed management methods, primarily relying on chemical herbicides, risk environmental contamination and lead to the emergence of herbicide-resistant species. Precision weeding, leveraging computer vision and machine learning methods, offers a promising eco-friendly alternative but is often limited by reliance on high-power computational platforms. This work presents an optimized, low-power edge AI system for weeds detection based on the YOLOv8n object detector deployed on the STM32U575ZI microcontroller. Several compression techniques are applied to the detection model, including structured pruning, integer quantization and input image resolution scaling in order to meet strict hardware constraints. The model is trained and evaluated on the CropAndWeed dataset with 74 plant species, achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and efficiency. Our system supports real-time, in-situ weeds detection with a minimal energy consumption of 51.8mJ per inference, enabling scalable deployment in power-constrained agricultural environments.</p></details> |  |

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

| **[Parallel Sampling via Autospeculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07869v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present parallel algorithms to accelerate sampling via counting in two settings: any-order autoregressive models and denoising diffusion models. An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $μ$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $μ$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $μ$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $μ$ is bounded. We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$ν$ that approximates~$μ$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $ν$ out of the same oracle that defines~$μ$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $ν$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps. This last fact is key to unlocking our parallel runtime of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a method for efficiently loading temperature, conductance, and submodel metrics using a side effect of TDs Compressed Solution Results (CSR) files. This approach can reduce the runtime for correlating model nodes and conductors with submodel IDs by orders of magnitude. Lastly, we reflect on the shortcomings of this method for reading data, consider the future of the GUI, and provide recommendations for subsequent OpenTD releases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 53rd International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES 2024), Louisville, Kentucky, USA, 2024.

| **[LLM Optimization Unlocks Real-Time Pairwise Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07555v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently reranking documents retrieved from information retrieval (IR) pipelines to enhance overall quality of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system remains an important yet challenging problem. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Benefit of Curriculum in Transformer Tree-Reasoning Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07372v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck. To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensitivity Analysis for Climate Science with Generative Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00663v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensitivity analysis is a cornerstone of climate science, essential for understanding phenomena ranging from storm intensity to long-term climate feedbacks. However, computing these sensitivities using traditional physical models is often prohibitively expensive in terms of both computation and development time. While modern AI-based generative models are orders of magnitude faster to evaluate, computing sensitivities with them remains a significant bottleneck. This work addresses this challenge by applying the adjoint state method for calculating gradients in generative flow models. We apply this method to the cBottle generative model, trained on ERA5 and ICON data, to perform sensitivity analysis of any atmospheric variable with respect to sea surface temperatures. We quantitatively validate the computed sensitivities against the model's own outputs. Our results provide initial evidence that this approach can produce reliable gradients, reducing the computational cost of sensitivity analysis from weeks on a supercomputer with a physical model to hours on a GPU, thereby simplifying a critical workflow in climate science. The code can be found at https://github.com/Kwartzl8/cbottle_adjoint_sensitivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-dimensional Bayesian filtering through deep density approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07261v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we benchmark two recently developed deep density methods for nonlinear filtering. Starting from the Fokker--Planck equation with Bayes updates, we model the filtering density of a discretely observed SDE. The two filters: the deep splitting filter and the deep BSDE filter, are both based on Feynman--Kac formulas, Euler--Maruyama discretizations and neural networks. The two methods are extended to logarithmic formulations providing sound and robust implementations in increasing state dimension. Comparing to the classical particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters, we benchmark the methods on numerous examples. In the low-dimensional examples the particle filters work well, but when we scale up to a partially observed 100-dimensional Lorenz-96 model the particle-based methods fail and the logarithmic deep density method prevails. In terms of computational efficiency, the deep density methods reduce inference time by roughly two to five orders of magnitude relative to the particle-based filters.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Rethinking Parameter Sharing as Graph Coloring for Structured Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06786v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep models have massive parameter sizes, leading to high inference-time memory usage that limits practical deployment. Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $α:L\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: "harmless" divergences that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within behavioral decision boundaries, and "pernicious" divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Approximation of Volterra Series for High-Dimensional Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06527v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Power to Precision: Learning Fine-grained Dexterity for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13710v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

| **[Learning stochasticity: a nonparametric framework for intrinsic noise estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13701v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically Interpretable World Models via Weakly Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12870v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning predictive models from high-dimensional sensory observations is fundamental for cyber-physical systems, yet the latent representations learned by standard world models lack physical interpretability. This limits their reliability, generalizability, and applicability to safety-critical tasks. We introduce Physically Interpretable World Models (PIWM), a framework that aligns latent representations with real-world physical quantities and constrains their evolution through partially known physical dynamics. Physical interpretability in PIWM is defined by two complementary properties: (i) the learned latent state corresponds to meaningful physical variables, and (ii) its temporal evolution follows physically consistent dynamics. To achieve this without requiring ground-truth physical annotations, PIWM employs weak distribution-based supervision that captures state uncertainty naturally arising from real-world sensing pipelines. The architecture integrates a VQ-based visual encoder, a transformer-based physical encoder, and a learnable dynamics model grounded in known physical equations. Across three case studies (Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, and Donkey Car), PIWM achieves accurate long-horizon prediction, recovers true system parameters, and significantly improves physical grounding over purely data-driven models. These results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of learning physically interpretable world models directly from images under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-driven Provenance Forensics for Threat Investigation and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21323v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PROVSEEK, an LLM-powered agentic framework for automated provenance-driven forensic analysis and threat intelligence extraction. PROVSEEK employs specialized toolchains to dynamically retrieve relevant context by generating precise, context-aware queries that fuse knowledge from threat reports with evidence from system provenance data. The framework resolves provenance queries, orchestrates multiple role-specific agents, and synthesizes structured, ground-truth verifiable forensic summaries. By combining agent orchestration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, data-guided filtration using a behavioral model, PROVSEEK enables adaptive multi-step analysis that iteratively refines hypotheses, verifies supporting evidence, and produces scalable, interpretable forensic explanations of attack behaviors. PROVSEEK is designed for automated threat investigation without task-specific training data, enabling forensic-style investigation even when no prior knowledge of the environment. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on publicly available DARPA datasets, demonstrating that PROVSEEK outperforms retrieval-based methods for the intelligence extraction task, achieving a 34% improvement in contextual precision/recall; and for threat detection task, PROVSEEK achieves 22%/29% higher precision/recall compared to both a baseline agent approach and State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS). In our scalability study, we show that PROVSEEK increases token usage by 1.42x and latency by 1.63x as the database size increases 50x, making it optimal for large-scale deployment. We also conducted an ablation and error analysis study to show how different components of PROVSEEK affect the detection performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Reinforcement Learning for Controlling Biological Networks - the GATTACA Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02712v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework. To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation. Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168v6)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlinear Output Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13595v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold π(w) and a feedforward input c(w) that render such manifold invariant. The pair (π(w), c(w)) is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates π(w) and c(w) by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni Memory System for Personalized, Long Horizon, Self-Evolving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13593v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.76% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[PASS: Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling for Interpretable and Adaptive Chest X-Ray Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10501v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i) black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs, pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, l figure, l table.

| **[Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agent for Trustworthy Legal Question Answering in Judicial Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01668v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence permeates judicial forensics, ensuring the veracity and traceability of legal question answering (QA) has become critical. Conventional large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, risking misleading guidance in legal consultation, while static knowledge bases struggle to keep pace with frequently updated statutes and case law. We present a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes retrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant evidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate candidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked answer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and provenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\_QA dataset show that our hybrid approach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla RAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm the complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling, and the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably reduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance, advancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness-Aware Graph Representation Learning with Limited Demographic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13540v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.</p></details> |  |

However, the high-altitude operation and inherent mobility of NTN introduce significant challenges across the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. Apart from that, how to achieve artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities in NTN for intelligent network management and orchestration remains an important challenge. To solve the challenges above, we propose integrating the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) with NTN as a promising solution, leveraging its principles of disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive technical literature on ORAN and NTN, respectively, there is a lack of a holistic view of the integration of ORAN and NTN architectures, particularly in terms of how intelligent ORAN can address the scalability challenge in NTN management. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured overview of an AI-native ORAN-based NTN framework to support dynamic configuration, scalability, and intelligent orchestration. The paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature from leading industry and academic institutions, subsequently providing the necessary background knowledge related to ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the unique DevOps challenges for NTN and proposes the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework, with a detailed discussion on the key technological enablers within the framework. Finally, this paper presents various use cases and outlines the prospective research directions of this study in detail.</p></details> |  |

Computational efficiency is crucial for scalable reservoir computing, requiring better strategies to reduce training cost. In this work, we uncover a connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. We show that NGRC can be trained without regularization, reducing computational time. Our contributions are twofold. First, merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags, high-degree polynomials, and short length of training data. Second, we evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, singular value decomposition (SVD), and lower-upper (LU) decomposition) for solving the regularized least-squares problem. Our results reveal that SVD-based training achieves accurate forecasts without regularization, being preferable when compared against the other algorithms.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

This paper leverages system symmetry to develop sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Under the symmetry assumption for a Markov Decision Process (MDP), a symmetric data augmentation method is proposed. The augmented samples are integrated into the dataset of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to enhance its coverage rate of the state-action space. Furthermore, sample utilization efficiency is improved by introducing a second critic trained on the augmented samples, resulting in a dual-critic structure. The aircraft's model is verified to be symmetric, and flight control simulations demonstrate accelerated policy convergence when augmented samples are employed.</p></details> |  |

However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings.

While previous research has explored various aspects of human-AI interaction, such as user perceptions and ethical considerations, there remains a gap in understanding the specific concerns and challenges users face. By using a lexical approach to analyze 55,968 online reviews from G2.com, Producthunt.com, and Trustpilot.com, this preliminary research aims to analyze human-AI interaction. Initial results from factor analysis reveal key factors influencing these interactions. The study aims to provide deeper insights into these factors through content analysis, contributing to the development of more user-centric AI systems. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of human-AI interaction and inform future AI technology and user experience improvements.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 table |
| **[Non-Linear Scoring Model for Translation Quality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13467v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analytic Translation Quality Evaluation (TQE), based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), traditionally uses a linear error-to-penalty scale calibrated to a reference sample of 1000-2000 words. However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition. Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size. Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0, anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added. The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment. Implementation considerations for CAT/LQA systems and implications for human and AI-generated text evaluation are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>ongoi...</summary><p>ongoing work, 38 pages</p></details> |
| **[Collective decision-making with higher-order interactions on $d$-uniform hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13452v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how group interactions influence opinion dynamics is fundamental to the study of collective behavior. In this work, we propose and study a model of opinion dynamics on $d$-uniform hypergraphs, where individuals interact through group-based (higher-order) structures rather than simple pairwise connections. Each one of the two opinions $A$ and $B$ is characterized by a quality, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$, and agents update their opinions according to a general mechanism that takes into account the weighted fraction of agents supporting either opinion and the pooling error, $α$, a proxy for the information lost during the interaction. Through bifurcation analysis of the mean-field model, we identify two critical thresholds, $α_{\text{crit}}^{(1)}$ and $α_{\text{crit}}^{(2)}$, which delimit stability regimes for the consensus states. These analytical predictions are validated through extensive agent-based simulations on both random and scale-free hypergraphs. Moreover, the analytical framework demonstrates that the bifurcation structure and critical thresholds are independent of the underlying topology of the higher-order network, depending solely on the parameters $d$, i.e., the size of the interaction groups, and the quality ratio. Finally, we bring to the fore a nontrivial effect: the large sizes of the interaction groups, could drive the system toward the adoption of the worst option.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Operational Patterns Using Image-Based Convolutional Clustering and Composite Evaluation: A Case Study in Foundry Melting Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13444v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term, high-fidelity simulation of slow-changing physical systems, such as the ocean and climate, presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.

We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>1.

| **[PAST: A Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13414v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thermally Activated Dual-Modal Adversarial Clothing against AI Surveillance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09829v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Kissing Numbers with Game-theoretic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13391v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Function as Qualified Pediatricians? A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13381v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence of Fixational and Saccadic Movements in a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13191v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for BNAIC/BeNeLearn 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Hierarchical Machine Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Slice Selection in In-Network Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metaverse promises immersive, real-time experiences; however, meeting its stringent latency and resource demands remains a major challenge. Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Satellite Swarm Deployment via Distance-based Orbital Transition Under $J_2$ Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01769v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an autonomous guidance and control strategy for a satellite swarm that enables scalable distributed space structures for innovative science and business opportunities. The averaged $J_2$ orbital parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces, thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a $J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Diffusion Autoencoder for Test-time Adapting Prediction of Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17459v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the behavior of complex systems is critical in many scientific and engineering domains, and hinges on the model's ability to capture their underlying dynamics. Existing methods encode the intrinsic dynamics of high-dimensional observations through latent representations and predict autoregressively. However, these latent representations lose the inherent spatial structure of spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to the predictor's inability to effectively model spatial interactions and neglect emerging dynamics during long-term prediction. In this work, we propose SparseDiff, introducing a test-time adaptation strategy to dynamically update the encoding scheme to accommodate emergent spatiotemporal structures during the long-term evolution of the system. Specifically, we first design a codebook-based sparse encoder, which coarsens the continuous spatial domain into a sparse graph topology. Then, we employ a graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the dynamics and guide a diffusion decoder for reconstruction. SparseDiff autoregressively predicts the spatiotemporal evolution and adjust the sparse topological structure to adapt to emergent spatiotemporal patterns by adaptive re-encoding. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that SparseDiff achieves an average prediction error reduction of 49.99\% compared to baselines, requiring only 1% of the spatial resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMUR: Large scale End-to-end MUltimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10962v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use as Many Surrogates as You Want: Selective Ensemble Attack to Unleash Transferability without Sacrificing Resource Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12644v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In surrogate ensemble attacks, using more surrogate models yields higher transferability but lower resource efficiency. This practical trade-off between transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all models should be \textit{identical} across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA), which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity. In this way, the number of within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models, SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency according to specific resource requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpe-Driven Stock Selection and Liquidiy-Constrained Portfolio Optimization: Evidence from the Chinese Equity Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13251v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops and empirically evaluates a Sharpe-driven stock selection and liquidity-constrained portfolio optimization framework designed for the Chinese equity market. The proposed methodology integrates three sequential stages: Sharpe-ratio-based universe selection, liquidity-adjusted mean-variance optimization, and multi-layered risk management implemented within an automated trading bot. Using daily price and volume data from 2023 to 2025 across the A-share universe, the framework dynamically identifies stocks exhibiting strong risk-adjusted performance while accounting for trading frictions and liquidity asymmetries that are common in emerging markets. Empirical backtests reveal that the proposed strategy achieves an annualized return of 25 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.71, and a maximum drawdown of 8.2 percent. These results significantly outperform the Buy-and-Hold benchmark, which records an annualized return of 21 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.62, and a drawdown of 7.6 percent over the same period. The superior performance demonstrates that incorporating risk-adjusted selection and liquidity-aware constraints enhances both profitability and stability, enabling the portfolio to capture upside potential while maintaining drawdown resilience. Beyond its empirical success, this study contributes methodologically by bridging classical mean-variance theory with practical liquidity adjustments and dynamic Sharpe-based screening. The resulting system not only improves the tradability of optimized portfolios but also provides a scalable and adaptive framework for quantitative asset allocation in liquidity-sensitive markets, offering new evidence that disciplined risk-return optimization can outperform passive investment strategies in the post-2023 Chinese equity landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tfin Crypto: From Speculation to Optimization in Risk Managed Crypto Portfolio Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13239v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocurrency trading has attracted tremendous attention from both retail and institutional investors. However, most traders fail to scale their assets under management due to fragile strategies that collapse during adverse markets. The primary causes are oversized leverage, speculative position sizing, and the absence of robust risk management or hedging mechanisms. This paper introduces Tfin Crypto, an end to end framework for crypto portfolio allocation that shifts the paradigm from speculation to optimization. The proposed pipeline consists of four stages: universe selection, alpha backtesting, volatility aware portfolio optimization, and dynamic drawdown based risk management. By combining operations research techniques with practical risk controls, Tfin Crypto enables scalable crypto portfolios that can withstand market downturns. In live 30 day trading on Binance Futures, the framework achieved a return on investment (ROI) of +16.68%, with the Sharpe ratio reaching 5.72 and the maximum drawdown contained at just 4.56%, demonstrating strong downside risk control. The system executed 227 trades, of which 131 were profitable, resulting in a win rate of 57.71% and a PnL of +1,137.49 USDT. Importantly, these results outperformed the buy and hold baseline (Sharpe 1.79, ROI 4.36%, MDD 4.96%) as well as several top leader copy trading bots on Binance, highlighting both the competitiveness and scalability of Tfin Crypto in real world trading environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Simulating Strategic and Goal-Oriented Data Marketplaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13233v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data marketplaces, which mediate the purchase and exchange of data from third parties, have attracted growing attention for reducing the cost and effort of data collection while enabling the trading of diverse datasets. However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between market participants, data, and regulations remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) for data marketplaces. In our framework, buyer and seller agents powered by LLMs operate with explicit objectives and autonomously perform strategic actions, such as planning, searching, purchasing, pricing, and updating data. These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset. The results demonstrate that LLM-MAS more faithfully reproduces trading patterns observed in real data marketplaces compared to traditional approaches, and further captures the emergence and evolution of market trends.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Private Frequency Estimation Via Residue Number Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11569v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection} (SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $Θ\bigl(ω\log_2(k/ω)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $ω\approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $Θ(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = Θ(\log k)$), this becomes $Θ(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022) while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that "free" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a "what-if" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[F.A.C.U.L.: Language-Based Interaction with AI Companions in Gaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13112v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative video games, traditional AI companions are deployed to assist players, who control them using hotkeys or command wheels to issue predefined commands such as ``attack'', ``defend'', or ``retreat''. Despite their simplicity, these methods, which lack target specificity, limit players' ability to give complex tactical instructions and hinder immersive gameplay experiences. To address this problem, we propose the FPS AI Companion who Understands Language (F.A.C.U.L.), the first real-time AI system that enables players to communicate and collaborate with AI companions using natural language. By integrating natural language processing with a confidence-based framework, F.A.C.U.L. efficiently decomposes complex commands and interprets player intent. It also employs a dynamic entity retrieval method for environmental awareness, aligning human intentions with decision-making. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our method supports real-time language interactions, enabling players to issue complex commands such as ``clear the second floor'', ``take cover behind that tree'', or ``retreat to the river''. The system provides real-time behavioral responses and vocal feedback, ensuring seamless tactical collaboration. Using the popular FPS game \textit{Arena Breakout: Infinite} as a case study, we present comparisons demonstrating the efficacy of our approach and discuss the advantages and limitations of AI companions based on real-world user feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures,</p></details> |
| **[MMEdge: Accelerating On-device Multimodal Inference via Pipelined Sensing and Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25327v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/HKUST-MINSys-Lab/MMEdge.

| **[Latency and Ordering Effects in Online Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13060v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online decision systems routinely operate under delayed feedback and order-sensitive (noncommutative) dynamics: actions affect which observations arrive, and in what sequence. Taking a Bregman divergence $D_Φ$ as the loss benchmark, we prove that the excess benchmark loss admits a structured lower bound $L \ge L_{\mathrm{ideal}} + g_1(λ) + g_2(\varepsilon_\star) + g_{12}(λ,\varepsilon_\star) - D_{\mathrm{ncx}}$, where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are calibrated penalties for latency and order-sensitivity, $g_{12}$ captures their geometric interaction, and $D_{\mathrm{ncx}}\ge 0$ is a nonconvexity/approximation penalty that vanishes under convex Legendre assumptions. We extend this inequality to prox-regular and weakly convex settings, obtaining robust guarantees beyond the convex case. We also give an operational recipe for estimating and monitoring the four terms via simple $2\times 2$ randomized experiments and streaming diagnostics (effective sample size, clipping rate, interaction heatmaps). The framework packages heterogeneous latency, noncommutativity, and implementation-gap effects into a single interpretable lower-bound statement that can be stress-tested and tuned in real-world systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Recurrent Adjacency Memory Network for Mixed-Generation Power System Stability Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03746v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |
